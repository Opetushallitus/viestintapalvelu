            <p>Congratulations! You have been accepted to the study programme mentioned above in the spring 2020 joint application to higher education.</p>

            <p>This letter also includes information about the situation of your other study options. If you have been placed on a waiting list for any of your study options, you can still be accepted to one of them if a place becomes available. You can find more information on the admission criteria of each study programme you have applied to from Studyinfo.fi and the higher education institution in question.</p>

            <h2>Confirming a study place</h2>

            <p>You have to confirm the study place mentioned above by 10 July 2020 at 3 pm (EEST) or you will lose the study place (Universities Act 38 § and 43 § / Polytechnics Act 28c § 32 §). You can only confirm the study place once and you cannot change the confirmation you have made afterwards. You can only confirm one higher education study place starting in the same academic term (1st August to 31th December 2020). When you confirm a study place rest of the offered study places will be cancelled automatically. You cannot be accepted to other programmes starting in the same academic term after you have confirmed a study place. The one place per term provision applies to both joint application and separate applications in higher education (transfer student applications are not included in the provision). Confirm the study place preferably electronically with the link that has been sent to your email or in the My Studyinfo -service. If you have Finnish online banking credentials, a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and a reader, you can confirm the place by logging in to the My Studyinfo -service from the link on top of the Studyinfo.fi front page. The My Studyinfo -service has instructions on how to confirm the study place electronically.</p>

            <p>If you cannot confirm the study place electronically, contact the higher education institution from which you want to confirm a study place. Make sure that the higher education institution receives your confirmation no later than by 10 July 2020 at 3 pm (EEST). If the confirmation arrives to the higher education institution late, you will lose the study place. </p>
            
            <p>When you confirm the study place, you will not be considered a first-time applicant in future applications.</p>

            <h2>Registering as a student</h2>
            <p>After you have confirmed the study place, you must also register as an attending or a non-attending student for the academic year 2020-2021 by the date given by the higher education institution or you will lose your right to study. After you have confirmed the study place, you can register as a student in the higher education institution either electronically (the link to the registration will open after you have confirmed the study place in the My Studyinfo -service) or in the way indicated by the higher education institution.</p>

<p>NB! If you are required to pay tuition fees, you cannot register for the academic year before you have completed your payment. You can check this from the higher education institution.</p>
    
            <p>You can register as non-attending for the first academic year only for statutory reasons, that is military or civilian service, maternity leave, paternity leave or parental leave or due to illness or disability. Not completing the registration will lead to forfeiting the right to study (Universities Act § 43 / Polytechnics Act § 32).</p>

            <h2>Applying for residency permit</h2>
            
            <p>Non-EU/EEA students need a student residence permit. You can begin the student residence permit application online at Enterfinland.fi. Remember that you must personally visit a Finnish embassy or consulate as part of this process. NB! Missions of the Finnish Ministry for Foreign affairs have interrupted the receiving and processing of residence permit applications on 19 March 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). While abroad, you can still submit your application through the Finnish Immigration Service’s Enter Finland online service. Your application will be accepted for processing once the exceptional arrangements are no longer in effect and you have identified yourself. Start your residence permit process as soon as possible, carefully following the immigration authorities’ instructions and regulations, so that you can receive your permit in good time before your studies begin! You can find detailed information and advice on the residence permit requirements and procedures on <a href="https://migri.fi/en/residence-permit-application-for-studies">the Finnish Immigration Service (Migri) website.</a></p>

                <li>Follow the processing of your application.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Due to prolonged residence permit application process, some higher education institutions may offer distance education if you cannot start your studies on time while you wait for your residence permit. You can find out if this is possible by contacting the higher educational institution, you were accepted to directly.</p>

            <h2>Conditional acceptance</h2>

            <p>According to the study programme’s admission criteria, your admission result may be conditional. Conditional acceptance is based on a degree with a certificate that cannot yet be obtained or on information you have provided and which will be checked later (for example, in admission to universities of applied sciences, general upper secondary school certificates or vocational upper secondary school certificates and higher education degree certificates as well as possible employment certificates). A conditional acceptance will be cancelled, if the higher education institution has not received copies of the required document(s) by the deadline. Please check the deadline from the admission criteria. A conditional acceptance may also be cancelled, if it has been made based on unconfirmed, predicted grades should the final grades be lower. If the information you have provided proves incorrect, your study place may be cancelled.</p>

                    The admission result
                </dt>
                <dd>The admission result can be accepted, accepted (conditional), on the waiting list, rejected or cancelled. The admission result will state "cancelled", if all the study places and reserve places for that study option have been filled and your score has not been sufficient for you to be admitted or placed on the waiting list. The higher education institutions can determine the number of reserve places for each study programme, and not all study programmes have reserve places. If your admission result states "rejected", you cannot be accepted to that study programme because you have not met the minimum of the admission requirements necessary to be admitted. In that case, you will see the reason for why you have not been admitted under the name of the study programme.

                    Selection method - Your score / The lowest accepted score
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Here you can see your own score in each of the study options’ selection methods and the lowest score that an applicant has been accepted with by the selection method in question. If the study programme uses a quota for first-time applicants, the lowest score for non-first-time applicants may be higher than the lowest score shown in the table with the results. The score may consist of several different parts. You can find information on how points are given from the study programme’s admission criteria. The total score may not always be the only deciding factor for student selections. For example, a failed language test or one failed section of the entrance examination may prevent the selection despite the total score. You can see the score only if it is possible to count the points for you according to this selection method. The column is empty if there are no points given in the selection method or if it is not possible to count your points.

                <dd>
                    Here you can see your reserve place status if you have been placed on a waiting list. It is possible that you have been placed on a waiting list in several queues in the same study programme. The selection methods are applied according to the higher education institution’s admission criteria. You can find more detailed information on the selection methods from the admission criteria of the study programme in question.

                <dd>
                    This admission result means that the admission decision is conditional and will be confirmed only after you have proven to the higher education institution that the condition has been met. Universities of applied sciences also use the term "Accepted" for conditional acceptance.
                </dd>
