<p>Congratulations! You have been accepted to the study programme(s) mentioned above in the spring 2020 joint application to higher education.</p>

<p>This letter also includes information about the situation of your other study options. If you have been placed on a waiting list for any of your study options, you can still be accepted to one of them if a place becomes available. You can find more information on the admission criteria of each study programme you have applied to from Studyinfo.fi and the higher education institution in question.</p>

<h2>Confirming a study place</h2>
<p>You must confirm the study place mentioned above by 17 July 2020 at 3 pm (EEST) or you will lose the study place (Universities Act 38 § and 43 § / Polytechnics Act 28c § 32 §). You can only confirm the study place once and you cannot change the confirmation you have made afterwards. You can only confirm one higher education study place starting in the same academic term (1st August to 31th December 2020). When you confirm a study place rest of the offered study places will be cancelled automatically. You cannot be accepted to other programmes starting in the same academic term after you have confirmed a study place. The one place per term provision applies to both joint application and separate applications in higher education (transfer student applications are not included in the provision). Confirm the study place preferably electronically with the link that has been sent to your email or in the My Studyinfo -service. If you have Finnish online banking credentials, a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and a reader, you can confirm the place by logging in to the My Studyinfo -service from the link on top of the Studyinfo.fi front page. The My Studyinfo -service has instructions on how to confirm the study place electronically.</p>
<p>If you cannot confirm the study place electronically, contact the higher education institution from which you want to confirm a study place. Make sure that the higher education institution receives your written confirmation no later than by 17 July 2020 at 3 pm (EEST). If the confirmation arrives to the higher education institution late, you will lose the study place.</p>
<p>When you confirm the study place, you will not be considered a first-time applicant in future applications.</p>

<h2>Registering as a student</h2>
<p>After you have confirmed the study place, you must also register as an attending or a non-attending student for the academic year 2020-2021 by the date given by the higher education institution or you will lose your right to study. After you have confirmed the study place, you can register as a student in the higher education institution either electronically (the link to the registration will open after you have confirmed the study place in the My Studyinfo -service) or in the way indicated by the higher education institution. NB! If you are required to pay tuition fees, you cannot register for the academic year before you have completed your payment. You can check this from the higher education institution.</p>
<p>You can register as non-attending for the first academic year only for statutory reasons, that is military or civilian service, maternity leave, paternity leave or parental leave or due to illness or disability. Not completing the registration will lead to forfeiting the right to study (Universities Act § 43 / Polytechnics Act § 32).</p>

<h2>Applying for residency permit</h2>
