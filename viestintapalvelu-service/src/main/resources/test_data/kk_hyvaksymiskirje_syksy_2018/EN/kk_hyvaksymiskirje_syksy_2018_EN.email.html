    <title>Notification of the student selection results in joint application to higher education</title>
</head>

<body>
<p><b>Dear applicant</b></p>
    
<p>You have applied for a study place in the autumn 2018 joint application to higher education. You can download and
    print your admission result letter through the following link <a href="$securelink/tuloskirje.pdf">$securelink/tuloskirje.pdf</a>.
    The link is valid for 3 months. Note that the letter shows your admission results according to the situation on November 29.
    Any changes in the admission situation (for example changes in your waiting list status) will not be updated to
    the result letter.</p>

<p>If you have been placed on the waiting list, the situation of the admission results can change daily. If you have a
    Finnish personal identity code and Finnish online banking credentials, a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and a
    reader, you can see your up-to-date situation in the My Studyinfo -service. You can log in to the service from the
    Studyinfo.fi front page.</p>

<p>If you have been granted a study place and you do not have a Finnish personal identity code, you can check your
    admission status and confirm the study place through the link that has been sent to your email. Applicants with a
    Finnish personal identity code can confirm a study place in the My Studyinfo -service.</p>

<p>Important dates:</p>

<p> - You need to accept the study place by 11 December 2018 at 3 pm</p>

<p> - You can be accepted as a student from the waiting list until 18 December 2018 at 3 pm (depending on the study
    programme). If you are accepted from the waiting list after this email, you will receive a separate notification
    informing you about it.</p>

<p>You can accept only one higher education study place starting in the same academic term (1 January to 31 July
    2019). The one study place per term provision applies to both higher education joint application and separate
    applications (transfer student applications are not included in the provision).</p>
