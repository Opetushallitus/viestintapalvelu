<body>
<p><b>Dear applicant</b></p>

<p>You have applied for a study place in the spring 2023 joint application to degree programmes in Finnish/Swedish. You can download and
    print your admission result letter through the following link <a href="$securelink/tuloskirje.html">$securelink/tuloskirje.html</a>.
    The link is valid three months. Note that the letter shows your admission results according to the situation on 6th July
    2023. Any changes in the admission situation (for example changes in your waiting list status) will not be updated to
    the result letter.</p>

<p>If you have been placed on the waiting list, the situation of the admission results can change daily. If you have a
    Finnish personal identity code and Finnish online banking credentials, a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and a
    reader, you can see your up-to-date situation in the <a href="https://studyinfo.fi/oma-opintopolku/">My Studyinfo's Applications and accepting the offer of admission -service</a>.</p>

<p>If you have been granted a study place and you do not have a Finnish personal identity code, you can confirm the study place through the link that has been sent to your email. Applicants with a Finnish personal identity code can accept the offer of admission in the My Studyinfo -service.</p>

<p>Important dates:</p>

<p> - You need to accept the possible offer of admission by 14th July 2023 at 3 pm. (UTC+3/EEST) 
    If you choose not to accept your offer, you can decline it. 
    When you decline the offer, the study place is freed for the person next on the waiting list.</p>

<p> - You can be accepted as a student from the waiting list until 1st August 2023 at 3 pm (UTC+3/EEST) (depending on the study
    programme). If you are accepted from the waiting list after this email, you will receive a separate notification
    informing you about it.</p>

<p> - If you believe there has been a mistake in the student selection and the admission criteria have not been applied correctly, 
    you can make a written request for rectification within 14 days after the student selection results have been 
    published, that is by 21st July 2023 at 3 pm (UTC+3/EEST) at the latest.</p>

<p>You may accept only one offer of admission leading to a higher education degree in Finland in education that begins in the same academic term 
    (1st August 2023 to 31st December 2023). When you accept an offer of admission, all other offers of admission will be cancelled automatically. 
    You cannot be accepted to other programmes starting in the same academic term after you have confirmed a study place. 
    The one study place per term provision applies to both higher education joint application and separate applications 
    (transfer student applications are not included in the provision).</p>
