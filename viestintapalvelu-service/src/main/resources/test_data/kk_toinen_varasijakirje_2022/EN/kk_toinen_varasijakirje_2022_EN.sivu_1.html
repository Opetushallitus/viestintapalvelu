<p>Congratulations! You have been accepted from a waiting list to the study programme(s) mentioned above in the spring 2022 joint application to degree programmes in Finnish/Swedish.</p>

<p>This letter also includes information about the situation of your other study options. After you have been accepted
    to the study place, your possible lower preferences have been cancelled automatically. If you have been placed on a
    waiting list for any of your higher preference study options, you can still be accepted to one of them if a place
    becomes available. You can find more information on the admission criteria of each study programme you have applied
    to from Studyinfo.fi and the higher education institution in question.</p>

<h2>Accepting an offer of admission</h2>

<p>You have to accept an offer of admission mentioned above by 15 July 2022 at 3 pm (UTC+3/EEST) or you 
    will lose the offered study place (Universities Act 38 § and 43 § / Polytechnics Act 28c § 32 §). 
    You can only accept an offer of admission once and you cannot change your answer afterwards. 
    You can only accept one higher education offer of admission to a study programme starting in the 
    same academic term (1st August to 31th December 2022). When you accept an offer of admission rest 
    of the offered study places will be cancelled automatically. You cannot be offered admission to other 
    programmes starting in the same academic term after you have accepted an offer of admission. The one 
    place per term provision applies to both joint application and separate applications in higher education 
    (transfer student applications are not included in the provision). Accept the offer of admission  
    preferably electronically with the link that has been sent to your email or in the My Studyinfo -service. 
    If you have Finnish online banking credentials, a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and a reader, 
    you can accept the offer of admission by logging in to the My Studyinfo -service from the link on top 
    of the Studyinfo.fi front page. The My Studyinfo -service has instructions on how to accept the offer 
    of admission electronically.</p>

<p>If you cannot accept the offer of admission electronically, contact the higher education institution 
    from which you want to accept the offer. Make sure that the higher education institution receives 
    your written confirmation no later than by 15 July 2022 at 3 pm (UTC+3/EEST). If the confirmation 
    arrives to the higher education institution late, you will lose the offered place.</p>

<p>When you accept the offer of admission, you will not be considered a first-time applicant in future 
    applications. More information: <a href="https://opintopolku.fi/konfo/en/sivu/provisions-and-restrictions-regarding-student-admissions-to-higher-education#quota-for-first-time-applicants"></a> </p>

<p> After you have confirmed the study place, you must also register as an attending or a non-attending student for the academic year 2022-2023
by the date given by the higher education institution or you will lose your right to study.</p>

<h2>Registering as a student</h2>
<p>You can register as a student in the higher education institution either electronically through the national
    registration service when you confirm the study place or in another way indicated by the higher education
    institution.</p>
<p>If you confirm the study place but remain on the waiting list for a study place higher on your preference list, you
    can only register as an attending or a non-attending student after your study place has been confirmed by the higher
    education institution. More detailed instructions on how to register can be found from the registration service and
    the higher education institution you have applied to (see the link "Instructions for new students" at the bottom of
    the page).</p>
<p>NB! If you are required to pay tuition fees, you cannot register for the academic year before you have completed
    your payment. You can check this from the higher education institution.</p>
<p>You can register as non-attending for the first academic year only for statutory reasons, that is military or
    civilian service, maternity leave, paternity leave or parental leave or due to illness or disability. Not completing
    the registration will lead to forfeiting the right to study (Universities Act § 43 / Polytechnics Act § 32).</p>
