Confirm the study place preferably electronically on the My Studyinfo -service. You can find instructions on page 3 as well as from Studyinfo.fi: Higher education > Applying > Results of the joint application to higher education.</p> <p>In addition to confirming the study place, you need to register as a student at the higher education institution. Registration is made with the electronic registration service OILI. If you confirm the study place on My Studyinfo -service, you can continue directly to the OILI registration service.

Conditional acceptance is based on a degree with a certificate that cannot yet be obtained or on information you have provided and which will be checked later (for example, in admission to universities of applied sciences, general upper secondary school certificates or vocational upper secondary school certificates and higher education degree certificates as well as possible employment certificates). A conditional acceptance will be cancelled, if the higher education institution has not received copies of the required document(s) by the deadline. Please check the deadline from the admission criteria. A conditional acceptance may also be cancelled, if it has been made based on unconfirmed, predicted grades should the final grades be lower. If the information you have provided proves incorrect, your study place may be cancelled.</p>  <h2>Appeals</h2> <p>If you believe there has been a mistake in the student selection and the admission criteria have not been applied correctly, you can make a written request for rectification within 14 days after the student selection results have been published, that is by <b>15 July 2016</b> at the latest before the closing time of the higher education institution. Always check the admission criteria of the study programme and the instructions regarding rectifications first. If necessary, you can then contact the higher education institution in question. You can make a written, individualized request for rectification before the deadline mentioned above. More detailed information about making a request for rectification and contact information can be found on the website and in the application material of the higher education institution in question. The higher education institution will not process a request for rectification if it concerns a study option that you have placed lower on your application than the one you have been accepted to.</p> <p>The request for rectification must be addressed to a recipient defined by the higher education institution and must be submitted to the address stated in the admission criteria by the deadline mentioned above.</p>  ","mandatory":false},{"id":0,"name":"sis2","defaultValue":"<p><b>Admission result</b> can be accepted, conditionally accepted, on the waiting list, failed or cancelled.
