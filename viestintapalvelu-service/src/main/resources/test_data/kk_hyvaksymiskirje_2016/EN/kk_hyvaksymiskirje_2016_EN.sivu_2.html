  <p><b>Admission result</b> can be accepted, conditionally accepted, on the waiting list, failed or cancelled. The admission result will state "cancelled", if you have been accepted to a higher preference. The admission result will also be cancelled if all the study places for that study option have been filled and your score has not been sufficient for you to be admitted to this study place. If your admission result states "failed", you cannot be accepted to that study place because you have not met the minimum of the admission requirements necessary to be admitted.
  </p>
  <p><b>Selection method</b> - Your score / the lowest accepted score / the lowest accepted score of a first-time applicant: Here you can see your own score in each of the study options' selection methods, the lowest score that an applicant has been accepted with by the selection method in question and the lowest score that a first-time applicant has been accepted with. The score may consist of several different parts. You can find information on how points are given from the study programme's admission criteria. The total score is not always the only thing that has influence on the result of student selection. For example, a failed language test or one failed section of the entrance examination may prevent the selection despite the total score. You can see the score only if it is possible to count the points for you according to this selection method. The column is empty if there are no points given in the selection method or if it is not possible to count your points.</p>
  <p><b>Your reserve place status</b> - Here you can see your reserve place status for the study place for which you have been placed on the waiting list. It is possible that you are on several reserve place queues for one study place. The selection methods are applied according to the higher education institution's admission criteria. You can find more detailed information on the selection methods from the admission criteria of the study programme in question.</p>
  <p><b>Conditional acceptance</b> - This admission result means that the admission decision is conditional and will be confirmed only after you have proven to the higher education institution that the condition has been met.</p>
  <p>If you need help with interpreting the selection results or if you need more detailed information about the basis for rejection, you can contact the admission services of the higher education institution in question.</p>
