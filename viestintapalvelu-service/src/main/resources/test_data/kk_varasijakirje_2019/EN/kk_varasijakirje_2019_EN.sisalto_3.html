    (Universities Act 38 § and 43 § / Polytechnics Act 28c § 32 §). Confirm the study place preferably electronically
    with the link that has been sent to your email or in the My Studyinfo -service. After you have confirmed the study

    registration will open after you have confirmed the study place in the My Studyinfo -service) or in the way
    indicated by the higher education institution.
</blockquote>

<h2>Confirming the study place</h2>
<p>You must confirm the study place within 10 days after you have been accepted to the study place. Check the deadline
    at the bottom of the form for notification of confirmation for this study place. You can only confirm the study
    place once and you cannot change the confirmation you have made afterwards. You can only confirm one higher
    education study place starting in the same academic term (1 August to 31 December 2018). The one place per term
    provision applies to both joint application and separate applications in higher education (transfer student
    applications are not included in the provision).</p>
<p>You can confirm the study place electronically with the link that has been sent to your email. If you have Finnish
    online banking credentials, a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and a reader, you can confirm the place by
    logging in to the My Studyinfo -service from the link on top of the Studyinfo.fi front page. The My Studyinfo
    -service has instructions on how to confirm the study place electronically.</p>
<p>If you cannot confirm the study place electronically, confirm the study place by using the form on the next page.
    Make sure the form arrives to the address stated on the bottom of the page within 10 days after you have been
    accepted to the study place. If the form arrives to the higher education institution late, you will lose the study
    place.</p>

<p><b>When you confirm the study place</b>, you will not be considered a first-time applicant in future applications.
    More information: Studyinfo.fi > Higher education > Applying > Quota for first-time applicants. After you have
    confirmed the study place, you must also register as an attending or a non-attending student for the academic year
    2018-2019 by the date given by the higher education institution or you will lose your right to study.</p>

<h2>Registering as a student</h2>
<p>You can register as a student in the higher education institution either electronically through the national
    registration service when you confirm the study place or in another way indicated by the higher education
    institution.</p>
<p>If you confirm the study place but remain on the waiting list for a study place higher on your preference list, you
    can only register as an attending or a non-attending student after your study place has been confirmed by the higher
    education institution. More detailed instructions on how to register can be found from the registration service and
    the higher education institution you have applied to (see the link "Instructions for new students" at the bottom of
    the page).</p>
<p>NB! If you are required to pay tuition fees, you cannot register for the academic year before you have completed 
    your payment. You can check this from the higher education institution.</p>
<p>You can register as non-attending for the first academic year only for statutory reasons, that is military or
    civilian service, maternity leave, paternity leave or parental leave or due to illness or disability. Not completing
    the registration will lead to forfeiting the right to study (Universities Act § 43 / Polytechnics Act § 32).</p>
