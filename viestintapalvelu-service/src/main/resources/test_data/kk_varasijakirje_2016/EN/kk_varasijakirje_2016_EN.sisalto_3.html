<h2>Registering as a student</h2>
<p>You can register as a student in the higher education institution either through the national registration service OILI when you confirm the study place or in another way indicated by the higher education institution.</p>
<p>If you confirm the study place but remain on the waiting list for a study place higher on your preference list, you can only register as an attending or a non-attending student after your study place has been confirmed by the higher education institution. More detailed instructions on how to register can be found from 1) OILI registration service 2) the higher education institution you have applied to (see the link "Instructions for new students" at the bottom of the page).</p>
<p>You can register as non-attending only for statutory reasons, that is military or civilian service, maternity leave, paternity leave or parental leave or due to illness or disability. Not completing the registration will lead to forfeiting the right to study (Universities Act § 43 / Polytechnics Act § 32).</p>
