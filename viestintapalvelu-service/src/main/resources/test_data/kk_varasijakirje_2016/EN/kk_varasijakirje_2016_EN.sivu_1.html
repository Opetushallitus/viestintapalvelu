  <p>NOTIFICATION OF THE STUDENT SELECTION RESULTS IN JOINT APPLICATION TO HIGHER EDUCATION AUTUMN 2016</p>
  <p><b>$koulu<br/>$koulutus</b></p>

  <p>You have been accepted from the waiting list to the study place mentioned above in the autumn 2016 joint application to higher education.</p>
  <blockquote>After you have been accepted to a study place, your possible lower preferences have been cancelled automatically. If you have been placed on the waiting list for any of your higher preference study options, you can still be accepted to one of them if a reserve place becomes available. You can find more information about the admission criteria of each study programme you have applied to from Studyinfo and the higher education institution in question.</blockquote>

  <h2>Accepting a study place</h2>
  <p>You have to confirm the study place by <b>$palautusTimestampEn</b> or you will lose the study place. Confirm the study place preferably electronically on My Studyinfo -service. You can find instructions on page 3 as well as from Studyinfo.fi: Higher education > Applying > Results of the joint application to higher education.</p>
  <p>In addition to confirming the study place, you need to register as a student at the higher education institution. If you confirm the study place on My Studyinfo -service, you can continue directly to the electronic registration service OILI. Each higher education institution has instructions on how to register and information on the start of studies on their own website: see the link "Instructions for new students" at the bottom of the page.</p>

  <h2>Appeals</h2>
  <p>If you believe there has been a mistake in the student selection and the admission criteria have not been applied correctly, you can do a written request for rectification within 14 days after the student selection results have been published but before the closing time of the higher education institution. Always check the admission criteria of the study programme and the instructions regarding rectifications first. If necessary, you can then contact the higher education institution in question. You can do a written, individualized request for rectification before the deadline mentioned above. More detailed information about making a request for rectification and contact information can be found on the website and in the application material of the higher education institution in question. The higher education institution will not process a request for rectification if it concerns a study option that you have placed lower on your application than the one you have been accepted to.</p>
  <p>The request for rectification must be addressed to a recipient defined by the higher education institution and must be submitted to the address stated in the admission criteria by the deadline mentioned above.</p>
