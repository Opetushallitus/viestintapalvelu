<h2>Conditional acceptance</h2>
<p>The situation of your study option on the admission results can be marked down as conditional. Conditional acceptance is based on a degree with a certificate that cannot yet be obtained or on information you have provided and which will be checked later (for example, in admission to universities of applied sciences, general upper secondary school certificates or vocational upper secondary school certificates and higher education degree certificates as well as possible employment certificates). A conditional acceptance will be cancelled, if the higher education institution has not received copies of the required document(s) by the deadline. Please check the deadline from the admission criteria. A conditional acceptance may also be cancelled, if it has been made based on unconfirmed, predicted grades should the final grades be lower. If the information you have provided proves incorrect, your study place may be cancelled.</p>
