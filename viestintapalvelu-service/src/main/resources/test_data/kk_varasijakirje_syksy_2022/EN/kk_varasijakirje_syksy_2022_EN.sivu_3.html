    <blockquote>Remember to confirm the study place and register as a student by the date given or you will lose the study
        place. (Universities Act 38 § and 43 § / Polytechnics Act 28c § 32 §). Confirm the study place preferably
        electronically with the link that has been sent to your email or in the My Studyinfo -service. After you have

    <h2>Accepting an offer of admission</h2>

    <p>You have to accept an offer of admission mentioned above by <b>$palautusTimestampEn</b> (UTC+2/EET) or you
        will lose the offered study place (Universities Act 38 § and 43 § / Polytechnics Act 28c § 32 §).
        You can only accept an offer of admission once and you cannot change your answer afterwards.
        You can only accept one higher education offer of admission to a study programme starting in the
        same academic term (1st January to 31st July 2023). When you accept an offer of admission rest
        of the offered study places will be cancelled automatically. You cannot be offered admission to other
        programmes starting in the same academic term after you have accepted an offer of admission. The one
        place per term provision applies to both joint application and separate applications in higher education
        (transfer student applications are not included in the provision). Accept the offer of admission
        preferably electronically with the link that has been sent to your email or in the My Studyinfo -service.
        If you have Finnish online banking credentials, a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and a reader,
        you can accept the offer of admission by logging in to the My Studyinfo -service from the link on top
        of the Studyinfo.fi front page. The My Studyinfo -service has instructions on how to accept the offer
        of admission electronically.</p>

    <p>If you cannot accept the offer of admission electronically, contact the higher education institution
        from which you want to accept the offer. Make sure that the higher education institution receives
        your written confirmation no later than by <b>$palautusTimestampEn</b> (UTC+2/EET). If the confirmation
        arrives to the higher education institution late, you will lose the offered place.</p>

    <p>When you accept the offer of admission, you will not be considered a first-time applicant in future
        applications. More information: <a href="https://opintopolku.fi/konfo/en/sivu/provisions-and-restrictions-regarding-student-admissions-to-higher-education#quota-for-first-time-applicants"></a> </p>

    <p> After you have confirmed the study place, you must also register as an attending or a non-attending student for the academic term of spring 2023
        by the date given by the higher education institution or you will lose your right to study.</p>

    <h2>Registering as a student</h2>
    <p>You can register as a student in the higher education institution either electronically through the national
        registration service when you confirm the study place or in another way indicated by the higher education
        institution.</p>
    <p>If you confirm the study place but remain on the waiting list for a study place higher on your preference list, you
        can only register as an attending or a non-attending student after your study place has been confirmed by the higher
        education institution. More detailed instructions on how to register can be found from the registration service and
        the higher education institution you have applied to (see the link "Instructions for new students" at the bottom of
        the page).</p>
    <p>NB! If you are required to pay tuition fees, you cannot register for the academic year before you have completed
        your payment. You can check this from the higher education institution.</p>
    <p>You can register as non-attending for the first academic year only for statutory reasons, that is military or civilian service,
        leave from studies to care for child in connection with the child's birth or adoption or due to illness or disability. Not completing
        the registration will lead to forfeiting the right to study (Universities Act § 43 / Polytechnics Act § 32).</p>
