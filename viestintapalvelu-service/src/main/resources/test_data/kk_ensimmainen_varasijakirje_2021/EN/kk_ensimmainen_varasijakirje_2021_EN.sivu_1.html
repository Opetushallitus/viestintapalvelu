<p>Congratulations! You have been accepted from a waiting list to the study place mentioned above in the spring 2020 joint application to higher education.</p>

<p>This letter also includes information about the situation of your other study options. If you have been placed on a
    waiting list for any of your other preference study options, you can still be accepted to one of them if a place
    becomes available. You can find more information on the admission criteria of each study programme you have applied
    to from Studyinfo.fi and the higher education institution in question.</p>

<h2>Confirming a study place</h2>
<p>You must confirm the study place mentioned above by <b>$palautusTimestampEn</b> or you will lose the study place 
    (Universities Act 38 ยง and 43 ยง / Polytechnics Act 28c ยง 32 ยง). You can only confirm the study place once and you 
    cannot change the confirmation you have made afterwards. You can only confirm one higher education study place 
    starting in the same academic term (1st August to 31th December 2020). When you confirm a study place rest of 
    the offered study places will be cancelled automatically. You cannot be accepted to other programmes starting 
    in the same academic term after you have confirmed a study place. The one place per term provision applies to 
    both joint application and separate applications in higher education (transfer student applications are not 
    included in the provision). Confirm the study place preferably electronically with the link that has been sent 
    to your email or in the My Studyinfo -service. If you have Finnish online banking credentials, a mobile certificate 
    or a smart ID card and a reader, you can confirm the place by logging in to the My Studyinfo -service from the 
    link on top of the Studyinfo.fi front page. The My Studyinfo -service has instructions on how to confirm the 
    study place electronically.</p>
<p>If you cannot confirm the study place electronically, contact the higher education institution from which you want 
    to confirm a study place. Make sure that the higher education institution receives your written confirmation no later 
    than by <b>$palautusTimestampEn</b>. If the confirmation arrives to the higher education institution late, you will 
    lose the study place.</p>
<p>When you confirm the study place, you will not be considered a first-time applicant in future applications.</p>
