<p>Congratulations! You have been offered admission from a waiting list to the study programme mentioned above in the spring 2021 joint application to higher education.</p>

<p>This letter also includes information about the situation of your other study options. If you have been placed on a
    waiting list for any of your other preference study options, you can still be accepted to one of them if a place
    becomes available. You can find more information on the admission criteria of each study programme you have applied
    to from Studyinfo.fi and the higher education institution in question.</p>

<h2>Accepting an offer of admission</h2>
<p>You have to accept the offer of admission mentioned above by <b>$palautusTimestampEn</b> or you will lose the study place 
    (Universities Act 38 ยง and 43 ยง / Polytechnics Act 28c ยง 32 ยง). You can only confirm the study place once and you cannot change the confirmation you have made afterwards. You can only accept one higher education offer of admission to a study programme starting in the same academic term (1 August to 31 December 2021). When you accept an offer of admission to one study programme the rest of the admission offers will be cancelled automatically. You cannot be offered admission to other study programmes starting in the same academic term after you have accepted an offer of admission. The one place per term provision applies to both joint application and separate applications in higher education (transfer student applications are not included in the provision). Accept the offer of admission preferably electronically with the link that has been sent to your email or in the My Studyinfo -service. If you have Finnish online banking credentials, a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and a reader, you can accept the offer of admission by logging in to the My Studyinfo -service from the link on top of the Studyinfo.fi front page. The My Studyinfo -service has instructions on how to accept an offer of admission electronically.</p>
<p>If you cannot accept an offer of admission electronically, contact the higher education institution from which you want to accept an offer. Make sure that the higher education institution receives your written confirmation no later than by <b>$palautusTimestampEn</b>. If the confirmation arrives to the higher education institution late, you will 
    lose the study place.</p>
<p>When you accept an offer of admission, you will not be considered a first-time applicant in future applications.</p>
