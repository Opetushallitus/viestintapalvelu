<p><b>The admission result can be accepted, accepted (conditional), on the waiting list, rejected or cancelled. The admission result will state "cancelled", if all the study places and reserve places for that study option have been filled and your score has not been sufficient for you to be admitted or placed on the waiting list. The higher education institutions can determine the number of reserve places for each study programme, and not all study programmes have reserve places. If your admission result states "rejected", you cannot be accepted to that study programme because you have not met the minimum of the admission requirements necessary to be admitted this time. In that case, you will see the reason for why you have not been admitted under the name of the study programme.</p>
<p><b>Selection method</b> - Your score / The lowest accepted score:<br/>Here you can see your own score in each of the
    study options’ selection methods and the lowest score that an applicant has been accepted with by the selection
    method in question. If the study programme uses a quota for first-time applicants, the lowest score for
    non-first-time applicants may be higher than the lowest score shown in the table with the results. The score may
    consist of several different parts. You can find information on how points are given from the study programme’s
    admission criteria. The total score may not always be the only deciding factor for student selections. For example,
    a failed language test or one failed section of the entrance examination may prevent the selection despite the total
    score. You can see the score only if it is possible to count the points for you according to this selection method.
    The column is empty if there are no points given in the selection method or if it is not possible to count your
    points.</p>
<p><b>Your reserve place status</b> - Here you can see your reserve place status if you have been placed on a waiting
    list. It is possible that you have been placed on a waiting list in several queues in the same study programme. The
    selection methods are applied according to the higher education institution’s admission criteria. You can find more
    detailed information on the selection methods from the admission criteria of the study programme in question.</p>
<p><b>Accepted (conditional)</b> - This admission result means that the admission decision is conditional and will be
    confirmed only after you have proven to the higher education institution that the condition has been met.
    Universities of applied sciences also use the term "Accepted" for conditional acceptance.</p>
<p>If you need help with interpreting the selection results or if you need more detailed information about the basis for
    rejection, you can contact the admission services of the higher education institution in question.</p>
