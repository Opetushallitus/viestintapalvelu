            <p>Congratulations! You have been accepted to the study place mentioned above in the autumn 2019 joint application to
                higher education.</p>

            <p>This letter also includes information about the situation of your other study options. After you have been accepted
                to the study place, your possible lower preferences have been cancelled automatically. If you have been placed on a
                waiting list for any of your higher preference study options, you can still be accepted to one of them if a place
                becomes available. You can find more information on the admission criteria of each study programme you have applied
                to from Studyinfo.fi and the higher education institution in question.</p>

            <h2>Confirming a study place</h2>

            <p>You have to confirm the study place mentioned above by <span class="bold">9th December 2019 at 3 pm (EET)</span> or you will lose the study place. Confirm
                the study place preferably electronically with the link that has been sent to your email or in the My Studyinfo
                -service. <a href="#opiskelupaikan_vastaanottaminen_seka_ilmoittautuminen_opiskelemaan">You can find instructions on chapter "Confirming the study place"</a> as well as from Studyinfo.fi: Higher education > Applying > Confirming
                a study place in higher education.</p>

            <p>In addition to confirming the study place, you need to register as a student at the higher education institution by
                the deadline. If you do not register by the deadline you will lose your right to study. If you confirm the study
                place in the My Studyinfo -service, you can continue directly to the electronic registration service. Each higher
                education institution has instructions on how to register and information on starting studies on their own website:
                <a href="#ohjeet_uusille_opiskelijoille">see the link on chapter "Instructions for new students".</a></p>

        <section>
            <h2>Conditional acceptance</h2>

            <p>According to the study programme&apos;s admission criteria, your admission result may be conditional. Conditional
                acceptance is based on a degree with a certificate that cannot yet be obtained or on information you have provided
                and which will be checked later (for example, in admission to universities of applied sciences, general upper
                secondary school certificates or vocational upper secondary school certificates and higher education degree
                certificates as well as possible employment certificates). A conditional acceptance will be cancelled, if the higher
                education institution has not received copies of the required document(s) by the deadline. Please check the deadline
                from the admission criteria. A conditional acceptance may also be cancelled, if it has been made based on
                unconfirmed, predicted grades should the final grades be lower. If the information you have provided proves
                incorrect, your study place may be cancelled.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Appeals</h2>

            <p>If you believe there has been a mistake in the student selection and the admission criteria have not been applied
                correctly, you can make a written request for rectification within 14 days after the student selection results have
                been published, that is by <span class="bold">13th December 2019</span> at the latest before the closing time of the higher education institution.
                Always check the admission criteria of the study programme and the instructions regarding rectifications first. If
                necessary, you can then contact the higher education institution in question. You can make a written, individualized
                request for rectification by the deadline mentioned above. More detailed information about making a request for
                rectification and contact information can be found on the website and in the application material of the higher
                education institution in question. The higher education institution will not process a request for rectification if
                it concerns a study option that you have placed lower on your application than the one you have been accepted
                to.</p>

            <p>The request for rectification must be addressed to a recipient defined by the higher education institution and must
                be submitted to the address stated in the admission criteria by the deadline mentioned above.</p>

            <p>Welcome to study!</p>

                <dd>The admission result can be accepted, accepted (conditional), on the waiting list, rejected or cancelled. The
                    admission result will state "cancelled", if you have been accepted to a higher preference. The admission result will
                    also be cancelled if all the study places and reserve places for that study option have been filled and your score
                    has not been sufficient for you to be admitted or placed on the waiting list. The higher education institutions can
                    determine the number of reserve places for each study programme, and not all study programmes have reserve places.
                    If your admission result states "rejected", you cannot be accepted to that study programme because you have not met
                    the minimum of the admission requirements necessary to be admitted. In that case, you will see the reason for why
                    you have not been admitted under the name of the study programme.

                    Here you can see your own score in each of the
                    study optionsâ€™ selection methods and the lowest score that an applicant has been accepted with by the selection
                    method in question. If the study programme uses a quota for first-time applicants, the lowest score for
                    non-first-time applicants may be higher than the lowest score shown in the table with the results. The score may
                    consist of several different parts. You can find information on how points are given from the study programmeâ€™s
                    admission criteria. The total score may not always be the only deciding factor for student selections. For example,
                    a failed language test or one failed section of the entrance examination may prevent the selection despite the total
                    score. You can see the score only if it is possible to count the points for you according to this selection method.
                    The column is empty if there are no points given in the selection method or if it is not possible to count your
                    points.

                    selection methods are applied according to the higher education institutionâ€™s admission criteria. You can find more
                    detailed information on the selection methods from the admission criteria of the study programme in question.

                    This admission result means that the admission decision is conditional and will be
                    confirmed only after you have proven to the higher education institution that the condition has been met.
                    Universities of applied sciences also use the term "Accepted" for conditional acceptance.

            <h2>Confirming the study place</h2>
            <p>You must confirm the study place by <span class="bold">9th December 2019 at 3 pm (EET)</span>. You can only confirm the study place once and you
                cannot change the confirmation you have made afterwards. You can only confirm one higher education study place
                starting in the same academic term (1st August to 31th December 2019). The one place per term provision applies to both
                joint application and separate applications in higher education (transfer student applications are not included in
                the provision).</p>
            <p>You can confirm the study place electronically with the link that has been sent to your email. If you have Finnish
                online banking credentials, a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and a reader, you can confirm the place by
                logging in to the My Studyinfo -service from the link on top of the Studyinfo.fi front page. The My Studyinfo
                -service has instructions on how to confirm the study place electronically.</p>
            <p>If you cannot confirm the study place electronically, confirm the study place by using the form on the next page. <a href="#opiskelupaikan_vastaanottoilmoitus">See section "notification of confirmation of a study place"</a>.
                Make sure the form arrives to the address stated on the bottom of the page by <span class="bold">9th December 2019 at 3 pm (EET)</span>. If the
                form arrives to the higher education institution late, you will lose the study place.</p>

            <p>When you confirm the study place, you will not be considered a first-time applicant in future applications.
                More information: Studyinfo.fi > Higher education > Applying > Quota for first-time applicants. After you have
                confirmed the study place, you must also register as an attending or a non-attending student for the academic year
                2019-2020 by the date given by the higher education institution or you will lose your right to study.</p>

            <h2>Registering as a student</h2>
            <p>You can register as a student in the higher education institution either electronically through the national
                registration service when you confirm the study place or in another way indicated by the higher education
                institution.</p>
            <p>If you confirm the study place but remain on the waiting list for a study place higher on your preference list, you
                can only register as an attending or a non-attending student after your study place has been confirmed by the higher
                education institution. More detailed instructions on how to register can be found from the registration service and
                the higher education institution you have applied to (<a href="#ohjeet_uusille_opiskelijoille">see the link on chapter "Instructions for new students"</a>).</p>
            <p>NB! If you are required to pay tuition fees, you cannot register for the academic year before you have completed
                your payment. You can check this from the higher education institution.</p>
            <p>You can register as non-attending for the first academic year only for statutory reasons, that is military or
                civilian service, maternity leave, paternity leave or parental leave or due to illness or disability. Not completing
