Conditional     acceptance is based on a degree with a certificate that cannot yet be obtained or on information you have provided     and which will be checked later (for example, in admission to universities of applied sciences, general upper     secondary school certificates or vocational upper secondary school certificates and higher education degree     certificates as well as possible employment certificates). A conditional acceptance will be cancelled, if the higher     education institution has not received copies of the required document(s) by the deadline. Please check the deadline     from the admission criteria. A conditional acceptance may also be cancelled, if it has been made based on     unconfirmed, predicted grades should the final grades be lower. If the information you have provided proves     incorrect, your study place may be cancelled.</p>  <h2>Appeals</h2> <p>If you believe there has been a mistake in the student selection and the admission criteria have not been applied     correctly, you can make a written request for rectification within 14 days after the student selection results have     been published, that is by <b>13th December 2019</b> at the latest before the closing time of the higher education institution.     Always check the admission criteria of the study programme and the instructions regarding rectifications first. If     necessary, you can then contact the higher education institution in question. You can make a written, individualized     request for rectification by the deadline mentioned above. More detailed information about making a request for     rectification and contact information can be found on the website and in the application material of the higher     education institution in question. The higher education institution will not process a request for rectification if     it concerns a study option that you have placed lower on your application than the one you have been accepted     to.</p> <p>The request for rectification must be addressed to a recipient defined by the higher education institution and must     be submitted to the address stated in the admission criteria by the deadline mentioned above.</p> ","mandatory":false},{"id":1,"name":"sis2","defaultValue":"<p><b>The admission result</b> can be accepted, accepted (conditional), on the waiting list, rejected or cancelled.

The higher education institutions can     determine the number of reserve places for each study programme, and not all study programmes have reserve places.

The score may                     consist of several different parts. You can find information on how points are given from the study programme’s                     admission criteria. The total score may not always be the only deciding factor for student selections. For example,                     a failed language test or one failed section of the entrance examination may prevent the selection despite the total                     score. You can see the score only if it is possible to count the points for you according to this selection method.                     The column is empty if there are no points given in the selection method or if it is not possible to count your                     points.                 </dd>                 <dt>                     Your reserve place status                 </dt>                 <dd>                     Here you can see your reserve place status if you have been placed on a waiting                     list. It is possible that you have been placed on a waiting list in several queues in the same study programme. The                     selection methods are applied according to the higher education institution’s admission criteria. You can find more                     detailed information on the selection methods from the admission criteria of the study programme in question.                 </dd>                 <dt>                     Accepted (conditional)                 </dt>                 <dd>                     This admission result means that the admission decision is conditional and will be                     confirmed only after you have proven to the higher education institution that the condition has been met.
