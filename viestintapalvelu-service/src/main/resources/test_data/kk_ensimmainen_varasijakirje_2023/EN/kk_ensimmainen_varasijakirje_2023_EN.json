After you have accepted the offer of admission, you can register as a student in the higher education institution either electronically (the link to the registration will open after you have accepted the offer of admission in the My Studyinfo -service) or in the way indicated by the higher education institution.</p> <p>NB! If you are required to pay tuition fees, you cannot register for the academic year before you have completed your payment. You can check this from the higher education institution.</p> <p>You can register as non-attending for the first academic year only for statutory reasons, that is military or civilian service, leave from studies to care for child in connection with the child's birth or adoption or due to illness or disability. Not completing the registration will lead to forfeiting the right to study (Universities Act § 43 / Polytechnics Act § 32).</p>  <h2>Applying for residency permit</h2> <p>Non-EU/EEA students need a student residence permit. You can begin the student residence permit application online at Enterfinland.fi immediately after you have been offered admission. Remember that you must personally visit a Finnish mission abroad as part of this process. While abroad, you can still submit your application through the Finnish Immigration Service’s Enter Finland online service.      Your application will be accepted for processing once you have identified yourself. Start your residence permit process as soon as possible, carefully following the immigration authorities’ instructions and regulations, so that you can receive your permit in good time before your studies begin! You can find detailed information and advice on the residence permit requirements and procedures on <a href=\"https://migri.fi/en/residence-permit-application-for-studies\">the Finnish Immigration Service (Migri) website.</a></p>  <h2>Conditional acceptance</h2> <p>According to the study programme’s admission criteria, your admission result may be conditional. Conditional acceptance is based on a degree with a certificate that cannot yet be obtained or on information you have provided and which will be checked later (for example, in admission to universities of applied sciences, general upper secondary school certificates or vocational upper secondary school certificates and higher education degree certificates as well as possible employment certificates).      A conditional acceptance will be cancelled, if the higher education institution has not received copies of the required document(s) by the deadline. Please check the deadline from the admission criteria. A conditional acceptance may also be cancelled, if it has been made based on unconfirmed, predicted grades should the final grades be lower. If the information you have provided proves incorrect, your study place may be cancelled.</p>  <h2>Appeals</h2> <p>If you believe there has been a mistake in the student selection and the admission criteria have not been applied correctly, you can make a written request for rectification within 14 days after the student selection results have been published, that is by 16 June 2023 at 3 pm (UTC+3/EEST). Always check the admission criteria of the study programme and the instructions regarding rectifications first.      If necessary, you can then contact the higher education institution in question. You can make a written, individualized request for rectification by the deadline mentioned above. More detailed information about making a request for rectification and contact information can be found on the website and in the application material of the higher education institution in question.</p> <p>The request for rectification must be addressed to a recipient defined by the higher education institution and must be submitted to the address stated in the admission criteria by the deadline mentioned above.</p> ","mandatory":false},{"id":1,"name":"sis2","defaultValue":"<p><b>The admission result</b> can be accepted, accepted (conditional), on the waiting list, rejected or cancelled.      The admission result will state \"cancelled\", if all the study places and reserve places for that study option have been filled and your score has not been sufficient for you to be admitted or placed on the waiting list.      The higher education institutions can determine the number of reserve places for each study programme, and not all study programmes have reserve places.      If your admission result states \"rejected\", you cannot be accepted to that study programme because you have not met the minimum of the admission requirements necessary to be admitted this time.      In that case, you will see the reason for why you have not been admitted under the name of the study programme.</p> <p><b>Selection method</b> - Your score / The lowest accepted score:<br/>Here you can see your own score in each of the     study options’ selection methods and the lowest score that an applicant has been accepted with by the selection     method in question. If the study programme uses a quota for first-time applicants, the lowest score for     non-first-time applicants may be higher than the lowest score shown in the table with the results. The score may     consist of several different parts. You can find information on how points are given from the study programme’s     admission criteria. The total score may not always be the only deciding factor for student selections. For example,     a failed language test or one failed section of the entrance examination may prevent the selection despite the total     score. You can see the score only if it is possible to count the points for you according to this selection method.     The column is empty if there are no points given in the selection method or if it is not possible to count your     points.</p> <p><b>Your reserve place status</b> - Here you can see your reserve place status if you have been placed on a waiting     list. It is possible that you have been placed on a waiting list in several queues in the same study programme. The     selection methods are applied according to the higher education institution’s admission criteria. You can find more     detailed information on the selection methods from the admission criteria of the study programme in question.</p> <p><b>Accepted (conditional)</b> - This admission result means that the admission decision is conditional and will be     confirmed only after you have proven to the higher education institution that the condition has been met.     Universities of applied sciences also use the term \"Accepted\" for conditional acceptance.</p> <p>If you need help with interpreting the selection results or if you need more detailed information about the basis for     rejection, you can contact the admission services of the higher education institution in question.</p> ","mandatory":false},{"id":3,"name":"subject","defaultValue":"Notification of the admission results in the joint application to higher education spring 2023","mandatory":false},{"id":4,"name":"kirjeotsikko","defaultValue":"Notification of the admission results in the joint application to higher education spring 2023","mandatory":false},{"id":9,"name":"sivu_2_otsikko","defaultValue":"Your current situation in the joint application to higher education spring 2023","mandatory":false}],"usedAsDefault":false,"structure":{"name":"kk_hyvaksymiskirje_rakenne","language":"EN","contentStructures":[{"type":"accessibleHtml","styleName":"kk_hyvaksymiskirje_tyyli","style":"html {   color: #2C3A40;

The                     admission result will state \"cancelled\", if you have been accepted to a higher preference. The admission result will                     also be cancelled if all the study places and reserve places for that study option have been filled and your score                     has not been sufficient for you to be admitted or placed on the waiting list. The higher education institutions can                     determine the number of reserve places for each study programme, and not all study programmes have reserve places.                     If your admission result states \"rejected\", you cannot be accepted to that study programme because you have not met                     the minimum of the admission requirements necessary to be admitted. In that case, you will see the reason for why                     you have not been admitted under the name of the study programme.                 </dd>                 <dt>                     Selection method - Your score / The lowest accepted score                 </dt>                 <dd>                     Here you can see your own score in each of the                     study options’ selection methods and the lowest score that an applicant has been accepted with by the selection                     method in question. If the study programme uses a quota for first-time applicants, the lowest score for                     non-first-time applicants may be higher than the lowest score shown in the table with the results. The score may                     consist of several different parts. You can find information on how points are given from the study programme’s                     admission criteria. The total score may not always be the only deciding factor for student selections. For example,                     a failed language test or one failed section of the entrance examination may prevent the selection despite the total                     score. You can see the score only if it is possible to count the points for you according to this selection method.                     The column is empty if there are no points given in the selection method or if it is not possible to count your                     points.                 </dd>                 <dt>                     Your reserve place status                 </dt>                 <dd>                     Here you can see your reserve place status if you have been placed on a waiting                     list. It is possible that you have been placed on a waiting list in several queues in the same study programme. The                     selection methods are applied according to the higher education institution’s admission criteria. You can find more                     detailed information on the selection methods from the admission criteria of the study programme in question.                 </dd>                 <dt>                     Accepted (conditional)                 </dt>                 <dd>                     This admission result means that the admission decision is conditional and will be                     confirmed only after you have proven to the higher education institution that the condition has been met.

You have been offered admission from a waiting list to the study programme mentioned above in the spring 2023 joint application to higher education.</p>  <p>This letter also includes information about the situation of your other study options.

You cannot be offered admission to other programmes starting in the same academic term after you have accepted an offer of admission.      The one place per term provision applies to both joint application and separate applications in higher education (transfer student applications are not included in the provision).</p>          <p><strong>If you choose not to accept your offer, you can decline it. When you decline the offer, the study place is freed for the person next on the waiting list. Declining an offer of admission is binding.</strong></p>Accept the offer of admission  preferably electronically with the link that has been sent to your email or in the My Studyinfo -service.           <p>Accept the offer of admission <strong>or decline it</strong> preferably electronically with the link that has been sent to your email or in the My Studyinfo -service.
