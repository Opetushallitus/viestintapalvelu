<h2>Registering as a student</h2>
<p>After you have accepted the offer of admission, you must also register as an attending or a non-attending student for the academic year 2023-2024 by the date given by the higher education institution or you will lose your right to study. 
    After you have accepted the offer of admission, you can register as a student in the higher education institution either electronically (the link to the registration will open after you have accepted the offer of admission in the My Studyinfo -service) or in the way indicated by the higher education institution.</p>
<p>NB! If you are required to pay tuition fees, you cannot register for the academic year before you have completed your payment. You can check this from the higher education institution.</p>
<p>You can register as non-attending for the first academic year only for statutory reasons, that is military or civilian service, leave from studies to care for child in connection with the child's birth or adoption or due to illness or disability. Not completing the registration will lead to forfeiting the right to study (Universities Act § 43 / Polytechnics Act § 32).</p>

<h2>Applying for residency permit</h2>
<p>Non-EU/EEA students need a student residence permit. You can begin the student residence permit application online at Enterfinland.fi immediately after you have been offered admission. Remember that you must personally visit a Finnish mission abroad as part of this process. While abroad, you can still submit your application through the Finnish Immigration Service’s Enter Finland online service. 
    Your application will be accepted for processing once you have identified yourself. Start your residence permit process as soon as possible, carefully following the immigration authorities’ instructions and regulations, so that you can receive your permit in good time before your studies begin! You can find detailed information and advice on the residence permit requirements and procedures on <a href="https://migri.fi/en/residence-permit-application-for-studies">the Finnish Immigration Service (Migri) website.</a></p>

<h2>Conditional acceptance</h2>
<p>According to the study programme’s admission criteria, your admission result may be conditional. Conditional acceptance is based on a degree with a certificate that cannot yet be obtained or on information you have provided and which will be checked later (for example, in admission to universities of applied sciences, general upper secondary school certificates or vocational upper secondary school certificates and higher education degree certificates as well as possible employment certificates). 
    A conditional acceptance will be cancelled, if the higher education institution has not received copies of the required document(s) by the deadline. Please check the deadline from the admission criteria. A conditional acceptance may also be cancelled, if it has been made based on unconfirmed, predicted grades should the final grades be lower. If the information you have provided proves incorrect, your study place may be cancelled.</p>

<h2>Appeals</h2>
<p>If you believe there has been a mistake in the student selection and the admission criteria have not been applied correctly, you can make a written request for rectification within 14 days after the student selection results have been published, that is by 16 June 2023 at 3 pm (UTC+3/EEST). Always check the admission criteria of the study programme and the instructions regarding rectifications first. 
    If necessary, you can then contact the higher education institution in question. You can make a written, individualized request for rectification by the deadline mentioned above. More detailed information about making a request for rectification and contact information can be found on the website and in the application material of the higher education institution in question.</p>
<p>The request for rectification must be addressed to a recipient defined by the higher education institution and must be submitted to the address stated in the admission criteria by the deadline mentioned above.</p>
