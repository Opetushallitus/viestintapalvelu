<p>Congratulations! You have been accepted to the study programme(s) mentioned above in the spring 2021 joint application to degree programmes in Finnish/Swedish.</p>

<p>This letter also includes information about the situation of your other study options. After you have been accepted
    to the study place, your possible lower preferences have been cancelled automatically. If you have been placed on a
    waiting list for any of your higher preference study options, you can still be accepted to one of them if a place
    becomes available. You can find more information on the admission criteria of each study programme you have applied
    to from Studyinfo.fi and the higher education institution in question.</p>

<h2>Accepting an offer of admission</h2>

<p>You must accept the offer of admission mentioned above by 16th July 2021 at 3 pm (EEST) or you will lose the study place. Accept the offer of admission  preferably electronically with the link that has been sent to your email or in the My Studyinfo
    -service. You can find instructions on chapter "Accepting the offer of admission and registration for studies"
    as well as from Studyinfo.fi: Higher education > How to apply for bachelor’s and master’s > Joint application > How to accept an offer of admission in 
    joint application to higher education. </p>

<p>In addition to accepting the offer of admission, you need to register as a student at the higher education institution by
    the deadline. If you do not register by the deadline you will lose your right to study. If you accept the offer of admission
    in the My Studyinfo -service, you can continue directly to the electronic registration service. Each higher
    education institution has instructions on how to register and information on starting studies on their own website:
    <a href="#ohjeet_uusille_opiskelijoille">see the link on chapter "Instructions for new students".</a></p>

<h2>Conditional acceptance</h2>
<p>According to the study programme's admission criteria, your admission result may be conditional. Conditional
    acceptance is based on a degree with a certificate that cannot yet be obtained or on information you have provided
    and which will be checked later (for example, in admission to universities of applied sciences, general upper
    secondary school certificates or vocational upper secondary school certificates and higher education degree
    certificates as well as possible employment certificates). A conditional acceptance will be cancelled, if the higher
    education institution has not received copies of the required document(s) by the deadline. Please check the deadline
    from the admission criteria. A conditional acceptance may also be cancelled, if it has been made based on
    unconfirmed, predicted grades should the final grades be lower. If the information you have provided proves
    incorrect, your study place may be cancelled.</p>

<h2>Appeals</h2>
<p>If you believe there has been a mistake in the student selection and the admission criteria have not been applied
    correctly, you can make a written request for rectification within 14 days after the student selection results have
    been published, that is by 23rd July 2021 at 3 pm (EEST).
    Always check the admission criteria of the study programme and the instructions regarding rectifications first. If
    necessary, you can then contact the higher education institution in question. You can make a written, individualized
    request for rectification by the deadline mentioned above. More detailed information about making a request for
    rectification and contact information can be found on the website and in the application material of the higher
    education institution in question. The higher education institution will not process a request for rectification if
    it concerns a study option that you have placed lower on your application than the one you have been accepted
    to.</p>
<p>The request for rectification must be addressed to a recipient defined by the higher education institution and must
    be submitted to the address stated in the admission criteria by the deadline mentioned above.</p>
