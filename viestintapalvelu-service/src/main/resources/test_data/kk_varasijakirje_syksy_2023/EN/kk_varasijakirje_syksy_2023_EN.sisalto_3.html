<h2>Confirming the study place</h2>
<p>You must confirm the study place within 7 days after you have been accepted to the study place. Check the deadline
    on the first page. You can only confirm the study place once and you
    cannot change the confirmation you have made afterwards. You may accept only one study place leading to a higher education degree in Finland 
    in education that begins in the same academic term 
    (1st January 2024 to 31st July 2024). When you confirm a study place other offered study places will be cancelled automatically. 
    You cannot be accepted to other programmes starting in the same academic term after you have confirmed a study place. 
    The one study place per term provision applies to both higher education joint application and separate applications 
    (transfer student applications are not included in the provision).</p>
<p>You can confirm the study place electronically with the link that has been sent to your email. If you have Finnish
    online banking credentials, a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and a reader, you can confirm the place by
    logging in to the My Studyinfo -service from the link on top of the Studyinfo.fi front page. The My Studyinfo
    -service has instructions on how to confirm the study place electronically.</p>
<p>If you cannot confirm the study place electronically, contact the higher education institution from which you want to confirm a study place. 
    Make sure that the higher education institution receives your written confirmation no later than within 7 days after you have been accepted to the study place. 
    If the confirmation arrives to the higher education institution late, you will lose the study place.</p>


<p>When you confirm the study place, you will not be considered a first-time applicant in future applications.
    More information: Studyinfo.fi > Higher education > Applying > Quota for first-time applicants. After you have
    confirmed the study place, you must also register as an attending or a non-attending student for the spring academic term 2024 
    by the date given by the higher education institution or you will lose your right to study.</p>

<h2>Registering as a student</h2>
<p>You can register as a student in the higher education institution either electronically through the national
    registration service when you confirm the study place or in another way indicated by the higher education
    institution.</p>
<p>If you confirm the study place but remain on the waiting list for a study place higher on your preference list, you
    can only register as an attending or a non-attending student after your study place has been confirmed by the higher
    education institution. More detailed instructions on how to register can be found from the registration service and
    the higher education institution you have applied to (see the link "Instructions for new students" at the bottom of
    the page).</p>
<p>NB! If you are required to pay tuition fees, you cannot register for the academic year before you have completed
    your payment. You can check this from the higher education institution.</p>
<p>You can register as non-attending for the first academic year only for statutory reasons, that is military or
    civilian service, maternity leave, paternity leave or parental leave or due to illness or disability. Not completing
    the registration will lead to forfeiting the right to study (Universities Act § 43 / Polytechnics Act § 32).</p>
