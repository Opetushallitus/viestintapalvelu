<p>Dear applicant,</p>

<p>You have applied for a study place in the spring 2022 joint application to degree programmes in Finnish/Swedish. Unfortunately you have
    not been accepted to the study programmes you applied to. On the second page of this letter you can find information
    about the situation of your study options in the student selection. If you have been placed on the waiting list for
    any of your study options, you can still be accepted to one of them if a place becomes available. The places that
    become available will be filled according to the reserve place order. You will be contacted by email, if you are
    accepted to a study place from the waiting list. Admissions from the waiting list end on 2nd August 2022 at 3 pm (UTC+3/EEST) at
    the latest. You can also see your waiting list situation from the My Studyinfo -service. In order to log in to the
    service you will need Finnish online banking credentials, a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and reader.</p>

<p>If the selection result for a study option is "rejected" or "cancelled", you cannot be admitted from the waiting
    list.</p>

<p>The admission criteria of each higher education institution are applied in the student selection process. You can get
    additional information about the admission criteria and the selection result from the higher education institution
    in question. If you need help with interpreting the selection results or more detailed information about the basis
    for rejection, you can contact the admission services of the higher education institution you have applied to.</p>

<h2>Appeals</h2>
<p>If you believe there has been a mistake in the student selection and the admission criteria have not been applied
    correctly, you can make a written request for rectification within 14 days after the student selection results have
    been published, that is before 22rd July 2022 at 3 pm (UTC+3/EEST).
    Always check the admission criteria of the study programme and the instructions regarding rectifications first. If
    necessary, you can then contact the higher education institution in question. You can make a written, individualized
    request for rectification by the deadline mentioned above. More detailed information about making a request for
    rectification and contact information can be found on the website and in the application material of the higher
    education institution in question. The request for rectification must be addressed to a recipient defined by the
    higher education institution and must be submitted to the address stated in the admission criteria by the deadline
    mentioned above.</p>

<p>If you were not accepted to any of your study options, you can look into the following options:</p>

<h2>Supplementary application rounds</h2>
<p>Some higher education institutions arrange their own supplementary application rounds in July-August, if all study places are not
    filled in the spring joint application. Check the exact dates for each possible supplementary application round from Studyinfo.fi.</p>

<h2>Open studies</h2>
<p>Both open university and open university of applied sciences offer open studies according to the higher education
    institution’s own curriculum. These studies are open for anyone and can contribute towards a degree, if you apply to
    study for a degree later. The studies will also give you an idea of what studying the field you are interested in is
    like and what it requires. You can find more information about open studies from each higher education institution’s
    own website and from Studyinfo.fi.</p>

<h2>Autumn joint application</h2>
<p>The next joint application to higher education starts on 31st Augst  and ends 14th September 2022 at Studyinfo.fi. You
    can find more information about the study programmes included in the autumn joint application from <a href="https://opintopolku.fi/konfo/en/haku?order=desc&size=20&sort=score&yhteishaku=1.2.246.562.29.00000000000000012989">Studyinfo.fi</a>.</p>
