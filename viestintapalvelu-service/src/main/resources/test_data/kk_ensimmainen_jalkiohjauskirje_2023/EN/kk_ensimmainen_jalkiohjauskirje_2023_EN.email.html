<p><b>Dear applicant</b></p>

<p>You have applied for a study place in the spring 2023 joint application to higher education.
    Unfortunately you have not been accepted to the study programmes you applied to.  
    On the second page of this letter you can find information about the situation of your study options in the student selection. 
    If you have been placed on the waiting list for any of your study options, you can still be accepted to one of them if a place becomes available. 
    The places that become available will be filled according to the waiting list order. You will be contacted by email, 
    if you are offered admission to a study programme from the waiting list. Admissions from the waiting list end on 1 august 2023 at 3 pm (UTC+3/EEST) at the latest. 
    You can also see your waiting list situation from the My Studyinfo -service. In order to log in to the service you will need Finnish online banking credentials, 
    a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and reader.</p>

<p>If the selection result for a study option is "rejected" or "cancelled", you cannot be admitted from the waiting list.</p>

<p>The admission criteria of each higher education institution are applied in the student selection process. 
    You can get additional information about the admission criteria and the selection result from the higher education institution in question.

    informing you about it.</p>
