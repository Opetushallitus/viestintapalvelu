Conditional     acceptance is based on a degree with a certificate that cannot yet be obtained or on information you have provided     and which will be checked later (for example, in admission to universities of applied sciences, general upper     secondary school certificates or vocational upper secondary school certificates and higher education degree     certificates as well as possible employment certificates). A conditional acceptance will be cancelled, if the higher     education institution has not received copies of the required document(s) by the deadline. Please check the deadline     from the admission criteria. A conditional acceptance may also be cancelled, if it has been made based on     unconfirmed, predicted grades should the final grades be lower. If the information you have provided proves     incorrect, your study place may be cancelled.</p>  <h2>Appeals</h2> <p>If you believe there has been a mistake in the student selection and the admission criteria have not been applied     correctly, you can make a written request for rectification within 14 days after the student selection results have     been published, that is by 9th December 2022 at 3 pm (UTC+2/EET).     Always check the admission criteria of the study programme and the instructions regarding rectifications first. If     necessary, you can then contact the higher education institution in question. You can make a written, individualized     request for rectification by the deadline mentioned above. More detailed information about making a request for     rectification and contact information can be found on the website and in the application material of the higher     education institution in question. The higher education institution will not process a request for rectification if     it concerns a study option that you have placed lower on your application than the one you have been accepted     to.</p> <p>The request for rectification must be addressed to a recipient defined by the higher education institution and must     be submitted to the address stated in the admission criteria by the deadline mentioned above.</p> ","mandatory":false},{"id":1,"name":"sis2","defaultValue":"<p><b>The admission result</b> can be accepted, accepted (conditional, on the waiting list, rejected or                     cancelled.

The total score may not always be the only deciding factor for student selections. For example,     a failed language test or one failed section of the entrance examination may prevent the selection despite the total     score.

The                     admission result will state \"cancelled\", if you have been accepted to a higher preference. The                     admission result will                     also be cancelled if all the study places and reserve places for that study option have been filled                     and your score                     has not been sufficient for you to be admitted or placed on the waiting list. The higher education                     institutions can                     determine the number of reserve places for each study programme, and not all study programmes have                     reserve places.                     If your admission result states \"rejected\", you cannot be accepted to that study programme because                     you have not met                     the minimum of the admission requirements necessary to be admitted this time. In that case, you will see the                     reason for why                     you have not been admitted under the admission result in each selection method.                 </dd>                 <dt>                     Selection method - Your score / The lowest accepted score                 </dt>                 <dd>                     Here you can see your own score in each of the                     study options’ selection methods and the lowest score that an applicant has been accepted with by the selection                     method in question. If the study programme uses a quota for first-time applicants, the lowest score for                     non-first-time applicants may be higher than the lowest score shown in the table with the results. The score may                     consist of several different parts. You can find information on how points are given from the study programme’s                     admission criteria. The total score may not always be the only deciding factor for student selections. For example,                     a failed language test or one failed section of the entrance examination may prevent the selection despite the total                     score. You can see the score only if it is possible to count the points for you according to this selection method.                     The column is empty if there are no points given in the selection method or if it is not possible to count your                     points.                 </dd>                 <dt>                     Your reserve place status                 </dt>                 <dd>                     Here you can see your reserve place status if you have been placed on a waiting                     list. It is possible that you have been placed on a waiting list in several queues in the same study programme. The                     selection methods are applied according to the higher education institution’s admission criteria. You can find more                     detailed information on the selection methods from the admission criteria of the study programme in question.                 </dd>                 <dt>                     Accepted (conditional)                 </dt>                 <dd>                     This admission result means that the admission decision is conditional and will be                     confirmed only after you have proven to the higher education institution that the condition has been met.                     Universities of applied sciences also use the term \"Accepted\" for conditional acceptance.                 </dd>             </dl>             <p>If you need help with interpreting the selection results or if you need more detailed information about the basis for                 rejection, you can contact the admission services of the higher education institution in question.

You can download and     print your admission result letter through the following link <a href=\"$securelink/tuloskirje.html\">$securelink/tuloskirje.html</a>.     The link is valid until 10th February 2023. Note that the letter shows your admission results according to the situation on 25th November     2022. Any changes in the admission situation (for example changes in your waiting list status) will not be updated to     the result letter.</p>  <p>If you have been placed on the waiting list, the situation of the admission results can change daily. If you have a     Finnish personal identity code and Finnish online banking credentials, a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and a     reader, you can see your up-to-date situation in the <a href=\"https://studyinfo.fi/oma-opintopolku/\">My Studyinfo's Applications and accepting the offer of admission -service</a>.</p>  <p>If you have been granted a study place and you do not have a Finnish personal identity code, you can confirm the study place through the link that has been sent to your email. Applicants with a Finnish personal identity code can accept the offer of admission in the My Studyinfo -service.</p>  <p>Important dates:</p>  <p> - You need to accept the possible offer of admission by 2nd December 2022 at 3 pm. (UTC+2/EET)</p>  <p> - You can be accepted as a student from the waiting list until 13th December 2022 at 3 pm (UTC+2/EET) (depending on the study     programme). If you are accepted from the waiting list after this email, you will receive a separate notification     informing you about it.</p>  <p> - If you believe there has been a mistake in the student selection and the admission criteria have not been applied correctly,      you can make a written request for rectification within 14 days after the student selection results have been      published, that is by 9th December 2022 at 3 pm (UTC+2/EET) at the latest.</p>  <p>You may accept only one offer of admission leading to a higher education degree in Finland in education that begins in the same academic term      (1st January 2023 to 31st July 2023). When you accept an offer of admission, all other offers of admission will be cancelled automatically.      You cannot be accepted to other programmes starting in the same academic term after you have confirmed a study place.      The one study place per term provision applies to both higher education joint application and separate applications      (transfer student applications are not included in the provision).</p>  <p><b>NB!</b> This message has been sent automatically from the Studyinfo.fi service.
