            <p>Congratulations! You have been offered admission to the study programme(s) mentioned above in the autumn 2021 joint application to
                higher education.</p>

            <p>This letter also includes information about the situation of your other study options. After you have been offered admission, 
                your possible lower preferences have been cancelled automatically. If you have been placed on a
                waiting list for any of your higher preference study options, you can still be offered admission to one of them if a place
                becomes available. You can find more information on the admission criteria of each study programme you have applied
                to from Studyinfo.fi and the higher education institution in question.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Accepting an offer of admission</h2>

            <p>You have to accept the offer of admission to a study programme(s) mentioned above before 3th December 2021 at 3 pm (EET) or 
                you will lose the study place. Accept the offer of admission preferably electronically with the link that has been sent to 
                your email or in the My Studyinfo -service. You can find instructions in chapter: <a href="#opiskelupaikan_vastaanottaminen_seka_ilmoittautuminen_opiskelemaan">"Accepting an offer of admission"</a> 
                as well as from Studyinfo.fi: <a href="https://opintopolku.fi/konfo/en/sivu/how-to-accept-an-offer-of-admission-in-joint-application-to-higher-education">Accepting an offer of admission in higher education.</a></p>

            <p>In addition to accepting an offer of admission, you need to register as a student at the higher education institution by
                the deadline. If you do not register by the deadline you will lose your right to study. If you accept an offer of admission
                in the My Studyinfo -service, you can continue directly to the electronic registration service. Each higher
                education institution has instructions on how to register and information on starting studies on their own website, see the link in chapter:
                <a href="#ohjeet_uusille_opiskelijoille">"Instructions for new students".</a></p>

        <section>
            <h2>Conditional offer of admission</h2>

            <p>According to the study programme's admission criteria, your admission result may be conditional. Conditional
                admission offer is based on a degree with a certificate that cannot yet be obtained or on information you have provided
                and which will be checked later (for example, in admission to universities of applied sciences, general upper
                secondary school certificates or vocational upper secondary school certificates and higher education degree
                certificates as well as possible employment certificates). A conditional admission offer will be cancelled, if the higher
                education institution has not received copies of the required document(s) by the deadline. Please check the deadline
                from the admission criteria. A conditional admission offer may also be cancelled, if it has been made based on
                unconfirmed, predicted grades should the final grades be lower. If the information you have provided proves
                incorrect, your study place may be cancelled.</p>

            <h2>Appeals</h2>

            <p>If you believe there has been a mistake in the student selection and the admission criteria have not been applied
                correctly, you can make a written request for rectification within 14 days after the student selection results have
                been published, that is before 10th December 2021 at 3 pm (EET).
                Always check the admission criteria of the study programme and the instructions regarding rectifications first. If
                necessary, you can then contact the higher education institution in question. You can make a written, individualized
                request for rectification by the deadline mentioned above. More detailed information about making a request for
                rectification and contact information can be found on the website and in the application material of the higher
                education institution in question. The higher education institution will not process a request for rectification if
                it concerns a study option that you have placed lower on your application than the one you have been accepted
                to.</p>

            <p>The request for rectification must be addressed to a recipient defined by the higher education institution and must
                be submitted to the address stated in the admission criteria by the deadline mentioned above.</p>

            <p>Welcome to study!</p>

                    on the waiting list, rejected or cancelled. 
                    The admission result will state "cancelled", if you have been accepted to a higher preference. The admission result will
                    also be cancelled if all the study places and reserve places for that study option have been filled and your score
                    has not been sufficient for you to be admitted or placed on the waiting list. The higher education institutions can
                    determine the number of reserve places for each study programme, and not all study programmes have reserve places.
                    If your admission result states "rejected", you cannot be accepted to that study programme because you have not met
                    the minimum of the admission requirements necessary to be admitted. In that case, you will see the
                    reason for why
                    you have not been admitted under admission result in each selection method.

                    Here you can see your own score in each of the
                    study options’ selection methods and the lowest score that an applicant has been accepted with by the selection
                    method in question. If the study programme uses a quota for first-time applicants, the lowest score for
                    non-first-time applicants may be higher than the lowest score shown in the table with the results. The score may
                    consist of several different parts. You can find information on how points are given from the study programme’s
                    admission criteria. The total score may not always be the only deciding factor for student selections. For example,
                    a failed language test or one failed section of the entrance examination may prevent the selection despite the total
                    score. You can see the score only if it is possible to count the points for you according to this selection method.
                    The column is empty if there are no points given in the selection method or if it is not possible to count your
                    points.

                    Here you can see your reserve place status if you have been placed on a waiting
                    list. It is possible that you have been placed on a waiting list in several queues in the same study programme. The
                    selection methods are applied according to the higher education institution’s admission criteria. You can find more
                    detailed information on the selection methods from the admission criteria of the study programme in question.

                    This admission result means that the admission decision is conditional and will be
                    confirmed only after you have proven to the higher education institution that the condition has been met.
                    Universities of applied sciences also use the term "Accepted" for conditional acceptance.

                After you have accepted the offer of admission, you must also register as a student to the higher education institution
                by the date given by the higher education institution or you will lose your right to study.</p>

            <h2>Registering as a student</h2>
            <p>You can register as a student in the higher education institution either electronically through the national
                registration service when you accept the offer of admission or in another way indicated by the higher education
                institution.</p>
            <p>If you accept the offer of admission but remain on the waiting list for an offer of admission higher on your preference list, you
                can only register as an attending or a non-attending student after your offer of admission is accepted and you will not be offered admission by the higher
                education institution. More detailed instructions on how to register can be found from the registration service and
                the higher education institution you have applied to. See the link on chapter: <a href="#ohjeet_uusille_opiskelijoille">"Instructions for new students"</a>.</p>
            <p>NB! If you are required to pay tuition fees, you cannot register for the academic year before you have completed
                your payment. You can check this from the higher education institution.</p>
            <p>You can register as non-attending for the first academic year only for statutory reasons, that is military or
                civilian service, maternity leave, paternity leave or parental leave or due to illness or disability. Not completing
                the registration will lead to forfeiting the right to study (Universities Act § 43 / Polytechnics Act § 32).</p>
