Unfortunately you have not been accepted to the study programmes you applied to. On the other side of this letter you can find information about the situation of your study options in the student selection. If you have been placed on the waiting list for any of your higher preference study options, you can still be accepted to one of them if a reserve place becomes available. The places that become available will be filled according to the reserve place order. You will be contacted separately, if you are accepted to a study place from the waiting list. Admissions from the waiting list end on <b>15 August 2016 at 3 pm</b> at the latest. You can also see your wait list situation from My Studyinfo -service. In order to log in to the service you will need Finnish online banking credentials, a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and reader.</p> <p>If the selection result for a study option is \"failed\", you cannot be admitted from the waiting list.</p> <p>The admission criteria of each higher education institution is applied in the student selection process. You can get additional information about the admission criteria and the selection result from the higher education institution in question. If you need help with interpreting the selection results or more detailed information about the basis for rejection, you can contact the admission services of the higher education institution you have applied to.</p>  <h2>Appeals</h2> <p>If you believe there has been a mistake in the student selection and the admission criteria have not been applied correctly, you can make a written request for rectification within 14 days after the student selection results have been published, that is by <b>15 July 2016</b> at the latest before the closing time of the higher education institution. Always check the admission criteria of the study programme and the instructions regarding rectifications first. If necessary, you can then contact the higher education institution in question. You can make a written, individualized request for rectification before the deadline mentioned above. More detailed information about making a request for rectification and contact information can be found on the website and in the application material of the higher education institution in question.</p> <p>The request for rectification must be addressed to a recipient defined by the higher education institution and must be submitted to the address stated in the admission criteria by the deadline mentioned above.</p> <p>If you were not accepted to any of your study options, you can look into the following options:</p>  <h2>Supplementary application round</h2> <p>Some higher education institutions arrange their own supplementary application rounds, if all study places are not filled in the spring joint application. Possible supplementary application rounds take place between 4 July and 31 August 2016. Check the exact dates for each possible supplementary application round from Studyinfo.fi.</p>  <h2>Open studies</h2> <p>Both open university and open university of applied sciences offer open studies according to the higher education institution’s own curriculum. These studies are open for anyone and can contribute towards a degree, if you apply to study for a degree later. The studies will also give you an idea of what studying the field you are interested in is like and what it requires. You can find more information about open studies from each higher education institution’s own website and from Studyinfo.fi.</p>  <h2>Autumn joint application</h2> <p>The next joint application to higher education starts on 7 September and ends 21 September at Studyinfo.fi. You can find more information about the study programmes included in the autumn joint application from Studyinfo.fi.</p> ","mandatory":false},{"id":0,"name":"sisalto_2","defaultValue":"<p><b>Admission result</b> can be accepted, conditionally accepted, on the waiting list, failed or cancelled. The admission result will state \"cancelled\", if you have been accepted to a higher preference. The admission result will also be cancelled if all the study places for that study option have been filled and your score has not been sufficient for you to be admitted to this study place. If your admission result states \"failed\", you cannot be accepted to that study place because you have not met the minimum of the admission requirements necessary to be admitted. </p> <p><b>Selection method</b> - Your score / the lowest accepted score / the lowest accepted score of a first-time applicant: Here you can see your own score in each of the study options' selection methods, the lowest score that an applicant has been accepted with by the selection method in question and the lowest score that a first-time applicant has been accepted with. The score may consist of several different parts. You can find information on how points are given from the study programme's admission criteria. The total score is not always the only thing that has influence on the result of student selection. For example, a failed language test or one failed section of the entrance examination may prevent the selection despite the total score. You can see the score only if it is possible to count the points for you according to this selection method. The column is empty if there are no points given in the selection method or if it is not possible to count your points.</p> <p><b>Your reserve place status</b> - Here you can see your reserve place status for the study place for which you have been placed on the waiting list. It is possible that you are on several reserve place queues for one study place. The selection methods are applied according to the higher education institution's admission criteria. You can find more detailed information on the selection methods from the admission criteria of the study programme in question.</p> <p><b>Conditional acceptance</b> - This admission result means that the admission decision is conditional and will be confirmed only after you have proven to the higher education institution that the condition has been met.</p> <p>If you need help with interpreting the selection results or if you need more detailed information about the basis for rejection, you can contact the admission services of the higher education institution in question.</p> ","mandatory":false},{"id":1,"name":"subject","defaultValue":"Hyväksymiskirje","mandatory":false},{"id":2,"name":"kirjeotsikko","defaultValue":"<p>NOTIFICATION OF THE STUDENT SELECTION RESULT IN JOINT APPLICATION TO HIGHER EDUCATION SPRING 2015</p>","mandatory":false}],"usedAsDefault":false,"structure":{"name":"kk_jalkiohjauskirje_rakenne","language":"EN","contentStructures":[{"type":"letter","styleName":"kk_jalkiohjauskirje_tyyli","style":"@page {   size: 210mm 297mm;
