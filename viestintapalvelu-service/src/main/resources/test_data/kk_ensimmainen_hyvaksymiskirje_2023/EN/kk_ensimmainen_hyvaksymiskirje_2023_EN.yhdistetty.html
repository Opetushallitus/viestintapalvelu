            <p>Accept the offer of admission <string>or decline it</string> preferably electronically with the link that has been sent to your email or 
                in the My Studyinfo -service. If you have Finnish online banking credentials, a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and a reader, you can accept the offer of admission by 
                logging in to the My Studyinfo -service from the link on top of the <a href="https://opintopolku.fi/konfo/en/">Studyinfo.fi</a> front page. You can find instructions on how

            <h2>Registering as a student</h2>
            <p> After you have accepted the offer of admission, you must also register as an attending or a non-attending student for the academic year 2023-2024 by the date given by the 
                higher education institution or you will lose your right to study. After you have accepted the offer of admission, you can register as a student in the higher education institution either electronically 
                (the link to the registration will open after you have accepted the offer of admission in the My Studyinfo -service) or in the way indicated by the higher education institution.</p>
            <p> If you accept the offer of admission but remain on the waiting list for a study place higher on your preference list, 
                you can only register as an attending or a non-attending student after your study place has been confirmed by the higher education institution. </p>
            <p>You can register as non-attending for the first academic year only for statutory reasons, that is military or civilian service, 
                leave from studies to care for child in connection with the child's birth or adoption or due to illness or disability. Not completing
                the registration will lead to forfeiting the right to study. (Universities Act § 43 / Polytechnics Act § 32)</p>

            <h2>Applying for a residence permit</h2>
            <p>Non-EU/EEA students need a student residence permit. You can begin the student residence permit application online at 
            <a href="https://enterfinland.fi/eServices">Enterfinland.fi</a> immediately after you have been offered admission. Remember that you must personally visit a Finnish mission abroad as part of this process. 
            While abroad, you can still submit your application through the Finnish Immigration Service’s Enter Finland online service. Your application will be accepted 
            for processing once you have identified yourself. Start your residence permit process as soon as possible, carefully following the immigration authorities’ 
            instructions and regulations, so that you can receive your permit in good time before your studies begin! You can find detailed information and advice on the 
            residence permit requirements and procedures on <a href="https://migri.fi/en/residence-permit-application-for-studies">the Finnish Immigration Service (Migri) website.</a></p>

            <h2>Conditional acceptance</h2>

            <p>According to the study programme’s admission criteria, your admission result may be conditional. 
                Conditional acceptance is based on a degree with a certificate that cannot yet be obtained or on 
                information you have provided and which will be checked later (for example, in admission to universities of applied sciences,
                unofficial copies, general upper secondary school certificates or vocational upper secondary school certificates and 
                higher education degree certificates as well as possible employment certificates). A conditional acceptance will be cancelled,
                if the higher education institution has not received copies of the required document(s) by the deadline. 
                Please check the deadline from the admission criteria. A conditional acceptance may also be cancelled, if it has been made based on unconfirmed,
                predicted grades should the final grades be lower. If the information you have provided proves incorrect, your study place may be cancelled.</p>

            <h2>Appeals</h2>

            <p>If you believe there has been a mistake in the student selection and the admission criteria have not been applied
                correctly, you can make a written request for rectification within 14 days after the student selection results have
                been published, that is by 16 June 2023 at 3 pm (UTC+3/EEST).
                Always check the admission criteria of the study programme and the instructions regarding rectifications first. If
                necessary, you can then contact the higher education institution in question. You can make a written, individualized
                request for rectification by the deadline mentioned above. More detailed information about making a request for
                rectification and contact information can be found on the website and in the application material of the higher
                education institution in question. The higher education institution will not process a request for rectification if
                it concerns a study option that you have placed lower on your application than the one you have been accepted
                to.</p>

            <p>The request for rectification must be addressed to a recipient defined by the higher education institution and must
                be submitted to the address stated in the admission criteria by the deadline mentioned above.</p>

                    also be cancelled if all the study places and reserve places for that study option have been filled
                    and your score
                    has not been sufficient for you to be admitted or placed on the waiting list. The higher education
                    institutions can
                    determine the number of reserve places for each study programme, and not all study programmes have
                    reserve places.
                    If your admission result states "rejected", you cannot be accepted to that study programme because
                    you have not met
                    the minimum of the admission requirements necessary to be admitted this time. In that case, you will see the
                    reason for why
                    you have not been admitted under the admission result in each selection method.

                    method in question. If the study programme uses a quota for first-time applicants, the lowest score for
                    non-first-time applicants may be higher than the lowest score shown in the table with the results. The score may
                    consist of several different parts. You can find information on how points are given from the study programme’s
                    admission criteria. The total score may not always be the only deciding factor for student selections. For example,
                    a failed language test or one failed section of the entrance examination may prevent the selection despite the total
                    score. You can see the score only if it is possible to count the points for you according to this selection method.
                    The column is empty if there are no points given in the selection method or if it is not possible to count your
                    points.

                    This admission result means that the admission decision is conditional and will be
                    confirmed only after you have proven to the higher education institution that the condition has been met.
                    Universities of applied sciences also use the term "Accepted" for conditional acceptance.
