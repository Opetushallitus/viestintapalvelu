            <p>Dear applicant</p>

            <p>You have applied for a study place in the autumn 2019 joint application to higher education.
                Unfortunately you have
                not been accepted to the study programmes you applied to. On the second page of this letter you can find
                information
                about the situation of your study options in the student selection. If you have been placed on the
                waiting list for
                any of your study options, you can still be accepted to one of them if a place becomes available. The
                places that
                become available will be filled according to the reserve place order. You will be contacted by email, if
                you are
                accepted to a study place from the waiting list. Admissions from the waiting list end on 17th December
                2019 at 3 pm at
                the latest. You can also see your waiting list situation from the My Studyinfo -service. In order to log
                in to the
                service you will need Finnish online banking credentials, a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and
                reader.</p>

            <p>If the selection result for a study option is "failed" or "cancelled", you cannot be admitted from the
                waiting
                list.</p>

            <p>The admission criteria of each higher education institution are applied in the student selection process.
                You can get
                additional information about the admission criteria and the selection result from the higher education
                institution
                in question. If you need help with interpreting the selection results or more detailed information about
                the basis
                for rejection, you can contact the admission services of the higher education institution you have
                applied to.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Appeals</h2>
            <p>If you believe there has been a mistake in the student selection and the admission criteria have not been
                applied
                correctly, you can make a written request for rectification within 14 days after the student selection
                results have
                been published, that is by 13th December 2019 at the latest before the closing time of the higher
                education institution.
                Always check the admission criteria of the study programme and the instructions regarding rectifications
                first. If
                necessary, you can then contact the higher education institution in question. You can make a written,
                individualized
                request for rectification by the deadline mentioned above. More detailed information about making a
                request for
                rectification and contact information can be found on the website and in the application material of the
                higher
                education institution in question. The request for rectification must be addressed to a recipient
                defined by the
                higher education institution and must be submitted to the address stated in the admission criteria by
                the deadline
                mentioned above.</p>

            <p>If you were not accepted to any of your study options, you can look into the following options:</p>

            <h2>Supplementary application round</h2>
            <p>Some higher education institutions arrange their own supplementary application rounds, if all study
                places are not
                filled in the spring joint application. Possible supplementary application rounds take place between 2nd
                December and
                13th December 2019. Check the exact dates for each possible supplementary application round from

            <h2>Open studies</h2>
            <p>Both open university and open university of applied sciences offer open studies according to the higher
                education
                institution’s own curriculum. These studies are open for anyone and can contribute towards a degree, if
                you apply to
                study for a degree later. The studies will also give you an idea of what studying the field you are
                interested in is
                like and what it requires. You can find more information about open studies from each higher education
                institution’s
                own website and from Studyinfo.fi.</p>

                </dt>
                <dd>The admission result can be accepted, accepted (conditional), on the waiting list, rejected or
                    cancelled. The
                    admission result will state "cancelled", if you have been accepted to a higher preference. The
                    admission result will
                    also be cancelled if all the study places and reserve places for that study option have been filled
                    and your score
                    has not been sufficient for you to be admitted or placed on the waiting list. The higher education
                    institutions can
                    determine the number of reserve places for each study programme, and not all study programmes have
                    reserve places.
                    If your admission result states "rejected", you cannot be accepted to that study programme because
                    you have not met
                    the minimum of the admission requirements necessary to be admitted. In that case, you will see the
                    reason for why
                    you have not been admitted under the name of the study programme.

                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Here you can see your own score in each of the
                    study options’ selection methods and the lowest score that an applicant has been accepted with by
                    the selection
                    method in question. If the study programme uses a quota for first-time applicants, the lowest score
                    for
                    non-first-time applicants may be higher than the lowest score shown in the table with the results.
                    The score may
                    consist of several different parts. You can find information on how points are given from the study
                    programme’s
                    admission criteria. The total score may not always be the only deciding factor for student
                    selections. For example,
                    a failed language test or one failed section of the entrance examination may prevent the selection
                    despite the total
                    score. You can see the score only if it is possible to count the points for you according to this
                    selection method.
                    The column is empty if there are no points given in the selection method or if it is not possible to
                    count your
                    points.

                    Your reserve place status
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Here you can see your reserve place status if you have been placed on a waiting
                    list. It is possible that you have been placed on a waiting list in several queues in the same study
                    programme. The
                    selection methods are applied according to the higher education institution’s admission criteria.
                    You can find more
                    detailed information on the selection methods from the admission criteria of the study programme in
                    question.

                    Accepted (conditional)
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    This admission result means that the admission decision is conditional and will be
                    confirmed only after you have proven to the higher education institution that the condition has been
                    met.
                    Universities of applied sciences also use the term "Accepted" for conditional acceptance.
                </dd>

            <p>If you need help with interpreting the selection results or if you need more detailed information about
                the basis for
                rejection, you can contact the admission services of the higher education institution in question.</p>
