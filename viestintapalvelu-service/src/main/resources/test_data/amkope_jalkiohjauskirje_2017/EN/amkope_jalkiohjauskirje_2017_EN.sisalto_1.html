<p>Notification of the result of student selection in the application to Vocational Teacher Education in 2017</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest in Vocational Teacher Education. Unfortunately you did not receive the required points for admission in this
    application process. Please see your score and the lowest accepted score in the attached table.</p>

<p>All eligible applicants who were not chosen for the studies are placed on a waiting list based on the points received. In case a study place
    becomes available, the vocational teacher education institution will contact the applicant. If you have personal bank identifiers of a Finnish bank,
    a mobile certificate or an electronic ID card with a chip granted by the Finnish police, you can check your situation in the selection daily by logging
    into the My Studyinfo service at www.studyinfo.fi. If you are selected as student from the waiting list, you can confirm your study place in the My
    Studyinfo service and you will also receive information about starting your studies by post or e-mail from the Vocational Teacher Education
    institution which has selected you.</p>
