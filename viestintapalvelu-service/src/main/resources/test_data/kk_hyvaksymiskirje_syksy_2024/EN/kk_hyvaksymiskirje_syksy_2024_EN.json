If the study programme uses a quota for first-time applicants, the lowest score for             non-first-time applicants may be higher than the lowest score shown in the table with the results. The score may             consist of several different parts. You can find information on how points are given from the study programme’s             admission criteria. The total score may not always be the only deciding factor for student selections. For example,             a failed language test or one failed section of the entrance examination may prevent the selection despite the total             score. You can see the score only if it is possible to count the points for you according to this selection method.

Always check the admission criteria of the study programme and the instructions regarding rectifications first. If                 necessary, you can then contact the higher education institution in question. You can make a written, individualized                 request for rectification by the deadline mentioned above. More detailed information about making a request for                 rectification and contact information can be found on the website and in the application material of the higher                 education institution in question. The higher education institution will not process a request for rectification if                 it concerns a study option that you have placed lower on your application than the one you have been accepted                 to.</p>              <p>The request for rectification must be addressed to a recipient defined by the higher education institution and must                 be submitted to the address stated in the admission criteria by the deadline mentioned above.</p>              <p>Welcome to study!</p>         </section>                   <section>             <h2>$sivu_2_otsikko</h2>             <p>All your study options in the order stated on your application</p> <ol class=\"tulokset\">                 #foreach( $tulos in $tulokset )                 <li class=\"hakukohde\">                     <div class=\"hakukohde-tiedot\">                         <div class=\"hakukohde-nimi#if($tulos.hyvaksytty=='true') bold#end\">                             $tulos.hakukohteenNimi -

The                     admission result will state \"cancelled\", if you have been accepted to a higher preference. The                     admission result will                     also be cancelled if all the study places and reserve places for that study option have been filled                     and your score                     has not been sufficient for you to be admitted or placed on the waiting list. The higher education                     institutions can                     determine the number of reserve places for each study programme, and not all study programmes have                     reserve places.                     If your admission result states \"rejected\", you cannot be accepted to that study programme because                     you have not met                     the minimum of the admission requirements necessary to be admitted this time. In that case, you will see the                     reason for why                     you have not been admitted under the admission result in each selection method.                 </dd>                 <dt>                     Selection method - Your score / The lowest accepted score                 </dt>                 <dd>                     Here you can see your own score in each of the                     study options’ selection methods and the lowest score that an applicant has been accepted with by the selection                     method in question. If the study programme uses a quota for first-time applicants, the lowest score for                     non-first-time applicants may be higher than the lowest score shown in the table with the results. The score may                     consist of several different parts. You can find information on how points are given from the study programme’s                     admission criteria. The total score may not always be the only deciding factor for student selections. For example,                     a failed language test or one failed section of the entrance examination may prevent the selection despite the total                     score. You can see the score only if it is possible to count the points for you according to this selection method.                     The column is empty if there are no points given in the selection method or if it is not possible to count your                     points.                 </dd>                 <dt>                     Your reserve place status                 </dt>                 <dd>                     Here you can see your reserve place status if you have been placed on a waiting                     list. It is possible that you have been placed on a waiting list in several queues in the same study programme. The                     selection methods are applied according to the higher education institution’s admission criteria. You can find more                     detailed information on the selection methods from the admission criteria of the study programme in question.                 </dd>                 <dt>                     Accepted (conditional)                 </dt>                 <dd>                     This admission result means that the admission decision is conditional and will be                     confirmed only after you have proven to the higher education institution that the condition has been met.                     Universities of applied sciences also use the term \"Accepted\" for conditional acceptance.                 </dd>             </dl>             <p>If you need help with interpreting the selection results or if you need more detailed information about the basis for                 rejection, you can contact the admission services of the higher education institution in question.
