Unfortunately you have     not been accepted to the study programmes you applied to. On the second page of this letter you can find information     about the situation of your study options in the student selection. If you have been placed on the waiting list for     any of your study options, you can still be accepted to one of them if a place becomes available. The places that     become available will be filled according to the reserve place order. You will be contacted by email, if you are     accepted to a study place from the waiting list. Admissions from the waiting list end on 2nd August 2022 at 3 pm (UTC+3/EEST) at     the latest. You can also see your waiting list situation from the My Studyinfo -service. In order to log in to the     service you will need Finnish online banking credentials, a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and reader.</p>  <p>If the selection result for a study option is \"rejected\" or \"cancelled\", you cannot be admitted from the waiting     list.</p>  <p>The admission criteria of each higher education institution are applied in the student selection process.

If you need help with interpreting the selection results or more detailed information about the basis     for rejection, you can contact the admission services of the higher education institution you have applied to.</p>  <h2>Appeals</h2> <p>If you believe there has been a mistake in the student selection and the admission criteria have not been applied     correctly, you can make a written request for rectification within 14 days after the student selection results have     been published, that is before 22rd July 2022 at 3 pm (UTC+3/EEST).     Always check the admission criteria of the study programme and the instructions regarding rectifications first. If     necessary, you can then contact the higher education institution in question. You can make a written, individualized     request for rectification by the deadline mentioned above. More detailed information about making a request for     rectification and contact information can be found on the website and in the application material of the higher     education institution in question. The request for rectification must be addressed to a recipient defined by the     higher education institution and must be submitted to the address stated in the admission criteria by the deadline     mentioned above.</p>  <p>If you were not accepted to any of your study options, you can look into the following options:</p>  <h2>Supplementary application rounds</h2> <p>Some higher education institutions arrange their own supplementary application rounds in July-August, if all study places are not     filled in the spring joint application. Check the exact dates for each possible supplementary application round from Studyinfo.fi.</p>  <h2>Open studies</h2> <p>Both open university and open university of applied sciences offer open studies according to the higher education     institution’s own curriculum. These studies are open for anyone and can contribute towards a degree, if you apply to     study for a degree later. The studies will also give you an idea of what studying the field you are interested in is     like and what it requires. You can find more information about open studies from each higher education institution’s     own website and from Studyinfo.fi.</p>  <h2>Autumn joint application</h2> <p>The next joint application to higher education starts on 31st Augst  and ends 14th September 2022 at Studyinfo.fi. You     can find more information about the study programmes included in the autumn joint application from <a href=\"https://opintopolku.fi/konfo/en/haku?order=desc&size=20&sort=score&yhteishaku=1.2.246.562.29.00000000000000012989\">Studyinfo.fi</a>.</p> ","mandatory":false},{"id":1,"name":"sis2","defaultValue":"<p><b>The admission result</b> can be accepted, accepted (conditional),      on the waiting list, rejected or cancelled. The admission result will state \"cancelled\", if you have been accepted to      a higher preference. The admission result will also be cancelled if all the study places and reserve places for that      study option have been filled and your score has not been sufficient for you to be admitted or placed on the waiting list.      The higher education institutions can determine the number of reserve places for each study programme, and not all study programmes have     reserve places. If your admission result states \"rejected\", you cannot be accepted to that study programme because     you have not met the minimum of the admission requirements necessary to be admitted this time. In that case, you will see the     reason for why you have not been admitted under the admission result in each selection method.</p> <p><b>Selection method</b> - Your score / The lowest accepted score:<br/>Here you can see your own score in each of the     study options’ selection methods and the lowest score that an applicant has been accepted with by the selection     method in question. If the study programme uses a quota for first-time applicants, the lowest score for     non-first-time applicants may be higher than the lowest score shown in the table with the results. The score may     consist of several different parts. You can find information on how points are given from the study programme’s     admission criteria. The total score may not always be the only deciding factor for student selections. For example,     a failed language test or one failed section of the entrance examination may prevent the selection despite the total     score. You can see the score only if it is possible to count the points for you according to this selection method.     The column is empty if there are no points given in the selection method or if it is not possible to count your     points.</p> <p><b>Your reserve place status</b> - Here you can see your reserve place status if you have been placed on a waiting     list. It is possible that you have been placed on a waiting list in several queues in the same study programme. The     selection methods are applied according to the higher education institution’s admission criteria. You can find more     detailed information on the selection methods from the admission criteria of the study programme in question.</p> <p><b>Accepted (conditional)</b> - This admission result means that the admission decision is conditional and will be     confirmed only after you have proven to the higher education institution that the condition has been met.     Universities of applied sciences also use the term \"Accepted\" for conditional acceptance.</p> <p>If you need help with interpreting the selection results or if you need more detailed information about the basis for     rejection, you can contact the admission services of the higher education institution in question.</p> ","mandatory":false},{"id":3,"name":"subject","defaultValue":"Notification of the admission results in autumn 2025 joint application","mandatory":false},{"id":4,"name":"kirjeotsikko","defaultValue":"Notification of the admission results in autumn 2025 joint application","mandatory":false},{"id":9,"name":"sivu_2_otsikko","defaultValue":"Your current situation in autumn 2025 joint application","mandatory":false}],"usedAsDefault":false,"structure":{"name":"kk_jalkiohjauskirje_rakenne","language":"EN","contentStructures":[{"type":"accessibleHtml","styleName":"kk_jalkiohjauskirje_tyyli","style":"html {   color: #2C3A40;   font-family: OpenSans, sans-serif;   font-size: 18px;   line-height: 1.5;   margin-left: auto;   margin-right: auto;   max-width: 60em; }  @media (max-width: 599px) {   html {     font-size: 16px;   } }  h1 {   font-size: 1.5em; }  h2 {   font-size: 1.25em; }  h3 {   font-size: 1em; }  dt, dd {   margin-bottom: 0.2em; }  dt {   font-weight: 600; }  blockquote {   background-color: #ebebeb;   margin: 0;   padding: 0.5em 1em; }  .hakukohteet {   list-style: inside none;   padding: 0;   margin: 0;   font-weight: 600; }  .tulokset {   list-style: inside none;   padding: 0;   margin: 0; }  .hakukohde {   background-color: #ebebeb;   margin-bottom: 0.5em;   padding: 2em; }  .hakukohde-tiedot {   display: flex;   margin-bottom: 2em; }  .hakukohde-nimi {   width: 60%;   padding-right: 1em; }  .hakukohde-tulos {   width: 40%;   padding-left: 1em; }  .valintatapajonot-table {   width: 100%;   border-collapse: collapse; }  .valintatapajono-table {   table-layout: fixed;   width: 100%;   border-collapse: collapse; }  .sarake {   width: 50%;   padding: 0.5em 1em;   border-bottom: 0.1em solid #2C3A40;   text-align: left;   vertical-align: top;   font-weight: 400; }  .sarake-kapea {   width: 20%; }  .sarake-levea {   width: 40%; }  .sarake:first-child {   padding-left: 0; }  .sarake:last-child {   padding-right: 0; }  .valintatapajonot-list {   list-style: inside none;   padding: 0;   margin: 0; }  .valintatapajono {   border-top: 0.15em solid #2C3A40;   margin-bottom: 2em; }  .valintatapajono:last-child {   margin-bottom: 0; }  @media (max-width: 599px) {   .hakukohde {     padding: 1em;   }    .hakukohde-tiedot {     flex-direction: column;   }    .hakukohde-nimi {     width: 100%;     padding-right: 0;     margin-bottom: 2em;   }    .hakukohde-tulos {     width: 100%;     padding-left: 0;   }    .valintatapajonot-table {     position: absolute;     overflow: hidden;     clip: rect(0 0 0 0);     height: 1px;     width: 1px;     margin: -1px;     padding: 0;     border: 0;   } }  @media (min-width: 600px) {   .valintatapajonot-list {     display: none;   } }  .bold {   font-weight: 600; }  .italic {   font-style: italic; }  @media only print {   html {     font-size: 14px;   }    article:not(:last-of-type) {     page-break-after: always;   } }  .opiskelupaikan-vastaanottoilmoitus-kaavake {   list-style-type: none }  .opiskelupaikan-vastaanottoilmoitus-kaavake__vaihtoehto::before {   content: \"\\2610\"; } ","contents":[{"role":"body","name":"jalkiohjauskirje_yhdistetty","contentType":"html","content":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"fi\" dir=\"ltr\">  <head>     <meta charset=\"utf-8\"/>     <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\"/>     <title>Notification of the admission results in autumn 2025 joint application</title>     <style>$tyylit</style> </head>  <body> <header role=\"banner\">     <dl>         #if($hakijapalveluidenOsoite)         <dt>             Sender         </dt>         <dd>             $hakijapalveluidenOsoite.organisaationimi <br/>             $hakijapalveluidenOsoite.addressline             #if($hakijapalveluidenOsoite.postalCode != '')             <br/>             $hakijapalveluidenOsoite.postalCode $hakijapalveluidenOsoite.city             #end         </dd>         <dd>         </dd>         #end         <dt>             Date         </dt>         <dd>             $letterDate         </dd>         <dt>             Recipient         </dt>         <dd>             $osoite         </dd>         <dt>             Date of birth         </dt>         <dd>             $syntymaaika         </dd>         <dt>             National learner ID         </dt>         <dd>             $hakijaOid         </dd>         <dt>             Application number         </dt>         <dd>             $hakemusOid         </dd>     </dl> </header>  <main role=\"main\">     <article>         <h1>$kirjeotsikko</h1>          <section>             <p>Dear applicant</p>              <p>You have applied for a study place in the autumn 2025 joint application.

The                     admission result will state \"cancelled\", if you have been accepted to a higher preference. The                     admission result will                     also be cancelled if all the study places and reserve places for that study option have been filled                     and your score                     has not been sufficient for you to be admitted or placed on the waiting list. The higher education                     institutions can                     determine the number of reserve places for each study programme, and not all study programmes have                     reserve places.                     If your admission result states \"You were not offered admission\", you cannot be accepted to that study programme because                     you have not met                     the minimum of the admission requirements necessary to be admitted this time. In that case, you will see the                     reason for why                     you have not been admitted under the admission result in each selection method.                 </dd>                 <dt>                     Selection method - Your score / The lowest accepted score                 </dt>                 <dd>                     Here you can see your own score in each of the                     study options’ selection methods and the lowest score that an applicant has been accepted with by                     the selection                     method in question. If the study programme uses a quota for first-time applicants, the lowest score                     for                     non-first-time applicants may be higher than the lowest score shown in the table with the results.                     The score may                     consist of several different parts. You can find information on how points are given from the study                     programme’s                     admission criteria. The total score may not always be the only deciding factor for student                     selections. For example,                     a failed language test or one failed section of the entrance examination may prevent the selection                     despite the total                     score. You can see the score only if it is possible to count the points for you according to this                     selection method.                     The column is empty if there are no points given in the selection method or if it is not possible to                     count your                     points.                 </dd>                 <dt>                     Your reserve place status                 </dt>                 <dd>                     Here you can see your reserve place status if you have been placed on a waiting                     list. It is possible that you have been placed on a waiting list in several queues in the same study                     programme. The                     selection methods are applied according to the higher education institution’s admission criteria.                     You can find more                     detailed information on the selection methods from the admission criteria of the study programme in                     question.                 </dd>                 <dt>                     Accepted (conditional)                 </dt>                 <dd>                     This admission result means that the admission decision is conditional and will be                     confirmed only after you have proven to the higher education institution that the condition has been                     met.                     Universities of applied sciences also use the term \"Accepted\" for conditional acceptance.                 </dd>             </dl>             <p>If you need help with interpreting the admission results or if you need more detailed information your admission result, you can contact the admission services of the higher education institution in question.

You can download and     print your admission result letter through the following link <a href=\"$securelink/tuloskirje.html\">$securelink/tuloskirje.html</a>.     The link is valid for three months. Note that the letter shows your admission results according to the situation on 20th November     2025. Any changes in the admission situation (for example changes in your waiting list status) will not be updated to     the result letter.</p>  <p>If you have been placed on the waiting list, the situation of the admission results can change daily. If you have a     Finnish personal identity code and Finnish online banking credentials, a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and a     reader, you can see your up-to-date situation on My Studyinfo.  <p>If you are offered admission and you do not have a Finnish personal identity code, you can accept the offer of admission through the link that has been sent to your email. Applicants with a Finnish personal identity code can accept the offer of admission in My Studyinfo.</p>  <p>Important dates:</p>  <p> - You need to accept the possible offer of admission by 27th November 2025 at 3 pm. (UTC+2/EET)      If you choose not to accept your offer, you can decline it.      When you decline the offer, the study place is freed for the person next on the waiting list.</p>  <p> - You can be accepted as a student from the waiting list until 8th December 2025 at 3 pm (UTC+2/EET) (depending on the study     programme). If you are accepted from the waiting list after this email, you will receive a separate notification     informing you about it.</p>  <p> - If you believe there has been a mistake in the student selection and the admission criteria have not been applied correctly,      you can make a written request for rectification within 14 days after the student selection results have been      published, that is by 4th December 2025 at 3 pm (UTC+2/EET) at the latest.</p>  <p>You may accept only one offer of admission leading to a higher education degree in Finland in education that begins in the same academic term      (1st January 2026 to 31st July 2026). When you accept an offer of admission, all other offers of admission will be cancelled automatically.      You cannot be accepted to other programmes starting in the same academic term after you have accepted an offer of admission.      The one study place per term provision applies to both higher education joint application and separate applications      (transfer student applications are not included in the provision).</p>  <p><b>NB!</b> This message has been sent automatically from the Studyinfo.fi service.
