<p>Congratulations! You have been offered admission to the study programme(s) mentioned above in the spring 2025 joint application to higher education.</p>

<p>This letter also includes information about the situation of your other study options. If you have been placed on a waiting list for any of your study options, you can still be offered admission to one of them if a place becomes available. You can find more information on the admission criteria of each study programme you have applied to from Studyinfo.fi and the higher education institution in question.</p>

<h2>Accepting an offer of admission</h2>
<p>Accept or decline the offer of admission with the link that has been sent to your email or in the My Studyinfo -service. You have to accept an offer of admission mentioned above by <b>$palautusTimestampEn</b> or you will lose the offered study place (Universities Act 38 § and 43 § / Polytechnics Act 28c § 32 §).</p>

<p>You can only accept or decilne an offer of admission once and you cannot change the answer you have made afterwards. You can only accept one higher education offer of admission to a study programme starting in the same academic term (1st August to 31th December 2025). When you accept an offer of admission rest of the offered study places will be cancelled automatically.</p>

<p>You cannot be offered admission to other programmes starting in the same academic term after you have accepted an offer of admission. The one place per term provision applies to both joint application and separate applications in higher education (transfer student applications are not included in the provision).</p>

<p>If you choose not to accept your offer, you should decline it. When you decline the offer, the study place is freed for the person next on the waiting list. Declining an offer of admission is binding.</p>

<p>If you have Finnish online banking credentials, a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and a reader, you can accept the offer of admission by logging in to the My Studyinfo -service front page. You can find instructions on how to accept the offer of admission electronically from My Studyinfo-service as well as on Studyinfo.fi</p>
<p>If you cannot accept the offer of admission electronically, contact the higher education institution from which you want to accept the offer. Make sure that the higher education institution receives your written confirmation no later than by <b>$palautusTimestampEn</b>. If the confirmation arrives to the higher education institution late, you will lose the offered place. </p>

<p>When you accept the offer of admission, you will not be considered a first-time applicant in future applications. You can find more information on this on Studyinfo.fi.</p>
