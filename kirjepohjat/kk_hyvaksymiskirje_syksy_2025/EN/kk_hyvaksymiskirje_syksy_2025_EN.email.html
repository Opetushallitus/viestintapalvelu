    <title>Notification of the student selection results in joint application to degree programmes in Finnish/Swedish spring 2024</title>
</head>

<body>
<p><b>Dear applicant</b></p>

<p>You have applied for a study place in the autumn 2024 joint application. You can download and
    print your admission result letter through the following link <a href="$securelink/tuloskirje.html">$securelink/tuloskirje.html</a>.
    The link is valid three months. Note that the letter shows your admission results according to the situation on 21st November
    2024. Any changes in the admission situation (for example changes in your waiting list status) will not be updated to
    the result letter.</p>

<p>If you have been placed on the waiting list, the situation of the admission results can change daily. If you have a
    Finnish personal identity code and Finnish online banking credentials, a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and a
    reader, you can see your up-to-date situation on My Studyinfo.

<p>If you are offered admission and you do not have a Finnish personal identity code, you can accept the offer of admission through the link that has been sent to your email. Applicants with a Finnish personal identity code can accept the offer of admission in My Studyinfo.</p>

<p>Important dates:</p>

<p> - You need to accept the possible offer of admission by 28th November 2024 at 3 pm. (UTC+2/EET) 
    If you choose not to accept your offer, you can decline it. 
    When you decline the offer, the study place is freed for the person next on the waiting list.</p>

<p> - You can be accepted as a student from the waiting list until 18th December 2024 at 3 pm (UTC+2/EET) (depending on the study
    programme). If you are accepted from the waiting list after this email, you will receive a separate notification
    informing you about it.</p>

<p> - If you believe there has been a mistake in the student selection and the admission criteria have not been applied correctly, 
    you can make a written request for rectification within 14 days after the student selection results have been 
    published, that is by 5th December 2024 at 3 pm (UTC+2/EET) at the latest.</p>

<p>You may accept only one offer of admission leading to a higher education degree in Finland in education that begins in the same academic term 
    (1st January 2025 to 31st July 2025). When you accept an offer of admission, all other offers of admission will be cancelled automatically. 
    You cannot be accepted to other programmes starting in the same academic term after you have accepted an offer of admission. 
    The one study place per term provision applies to both higher education joint application and separate applications 
    (transfer student applications are not included in the provision).</p>
