    <h2>Applying for a residence permit</h2>
    <p>Non-EU/EEA students need a student residence permit. You can begin the student residence permit application online at 
    <a href="https://enterfinland.fi/eServices">Enterfinland.fi</a> immediately after you have been offered admission. Remember that you must personally visit a Finnish mission abroad as part of this process. 
    While abroad, you can still submit your application through the Finnish Immigration Service’s Enter Finland online service. Your application will be accepted 
    for processing once you have identified yourself. Start your residence permit process as soon as possible, carefully following the immigration authorities’ 
    instructions and regulations, so that you can receive your permit in good time before your studies begin! You can find detailed information and advice on the 
    residence permit requirements and procedures on <a href="https://migri.fi/en/residence-permit-application-for-studies">the Finnish Immigration Service (Migri) website.</a></p>
